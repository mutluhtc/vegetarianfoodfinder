Konkani Style Sungta Ambat Aani Tallel Sungta Recipe- Fried Prawns & Curry," is what they call the prawn's curry and fried prawns in the Konkani language.

The word sola can be confused with kokum which too are called sola in other languages. I have used tamarind instead as these sola are mostly not available anywhere else. This doesn't affect the taste of the gravy in any way. Also, the spices applied to the fish for frying were then ground on a ragda which gave a thick paste.
