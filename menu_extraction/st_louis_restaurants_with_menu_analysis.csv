Amazing spot for a dinner date, a few glasses of wine or a night cap. Sat at the bar and had a few drinks with a friend for this visit. Bar tender was attentive and the staff was super nice and accommodating the second I walked in. Appetizer menu is delicious, not one bad thing...

Went there for our wedding anniversary. Great ambience (we lucked out and got one of the 4 little tables in the 2 front window areas, which added privacy and cut down on noise). The food was delicious, especially the carnitas tacos and the stuffed mushrooms...

Though I haven't been yet for dinner, this is my very favorite lunch spot!  Small and, best of all, QUIET, the food is excellent and I have tried many of the appetizers and  sandwiches. Soups are excellent!  Prices are quite reasonable...

Q:
How much indoor seating does this location have?
A:
Maybe 4 seats at a counter by the window, maybe 3 or so small tables. I'm going from memory after being there a few weeks ago, I won't be mad at any corrections.

Prompt service. Ate in the bar area at a high top table. Very comfortable atmosphere. Bar tender was polite and accommodating, checking on me, and other patrons, regularly. Food was so good! Beer was cold!

five star review by
Mark Z.:
One of the best Irish pubs in town, right in the heart of Irish Dogtown. The back patio is fantastic -- a great place to grab a bite or drink on a warm summer day. Super bar as you enter, and a dining area with wooden booths, tables and chairs. The portions are ample and the food is a notch above. Overall this is a very pleasant, authentic Irish pub!

Candice K.:
Seamus is always our go to place to take our 3 young kids. They even have newly updated kids menus that have plenty of kid aproved foods and come with drinks! The patio is perfect on a nice day. The buffalo chicken sandwich is gigantic and delicious and the ranch it comes with is worth the price alone- SO good! Their burgers are huge and really good as well. The servers are always nice and attentive and the beers are always cold.

About us
In early November 2010 Bottle Cellars opened it's doors for the first time. It was a small wine shop whose mission was to offer quality and affordable wines in an informative, enjoyable and unique shopping environment. As time went on Bottle Cellars starting expanding it's selection by adding cheese, whiskey, and craft beer to the products it sold. After a few years a small patio was added and we began offering wines by the glass along with simple cheese and charcuterie boards. Everything was going great but after five years in business something became obvious, our customers wanted more... and so did we.
Cellar House
In 2015 we expanded and added a small wine bar we named Cellar House next door to Bottle Cellars. The premise was simple, keep selling the same quality and affordable wines we had been, but offer our customers an appropriate and relaxing place to enjoy them. We also expanded our food menu beyond simple cheese and charcuterie boards to include flatbreads, sliders, and small plates. As time went on the menu at Cellar House began to evolve and we started to notice a change. No longer were our guests coming in for a drink and snack before or after dinner, they were coming in for dinner. Our small wine bar had transformed itself into a restaurant. We were thrilled, and business started to boom. But there was a problem, our kitchen wasn't designed to handle the volume of food we were starting to serve. So after five more years of business it was time to find a new home.
Luckily for us
the search for a new home didn't take us too long or too far away. On June 17th, 2020 Cellar House re-opened in its new home at 5634 Telegraph Road, just one mile north of its original location. With more seating, a larger patio, and a bigger and better equipped kitchen we are excited for what the future holds.

Leah L.:
I wish I remembered to take pictures; but I enjoyed my time some much. Great service, loved the food and had a great bottle of Wine.  It was super clean and o love the decor and being able to see the kitchen. We will be going back for sure.
Review by - Google
Sarah B.:
This place is an amazing little spot in Oakville! Friends and I enjoyed our meals, sharing Starters and the dessert. We met the chef who was very nice and gave us some insight on how she plans the menu. The fancy mixed drinks are very unique and work well with the menu! The menu is seasonal and we had the Winter 2023 menu but we'll be back to try the Spring menu in April!
Review by - Yelp
Matthew P.:
Something you would never expect in south county. Exceptional menu which seems to change regularly (if it's on the menu try the poke nachos, wicked good). Service is great, the last two times the bartender has taken care of us. He is attentive, funny, and makes a great drink.
Review by - Google
Meshelle B.:
The food is amazing!! Eclectic, high-end dining, and we WILL be back. I can not say enough good things about our experience. I had the best flatbread. And get the crispy Brussel sprouts. Staff is amazing.  Reservations are highly encouraged.
Review by - Yelp
Tom J.:
This is the place to be in Oakville, which is not saying much, granted.  We especially love the shrimp and grits appetizer and of course the wine list, as the owners started out with a wine shop down the street. The vibe is lively and a bit loud.  A great date spot.
Review by - Google
Kayla S.:
Had the Hazelnut Encrusted Walleye and it was cooked to perfection! They've featured a different fish each night I've been. I've had the salmon, Sea bass, and walleye and they were cooked beautifully! As well as various other items on the menu...

Sharon C.:
Went to Cellar House last nite for our daughter's birthday. It was an exceptional meal , starting with drinks, appetizers entree then dessert.  It's wonderful having a restaurant of this quality in South County at last. Can't wait to go back.

Chris M.:
Dinner and the experience were very good, and some of the best cocktails I've had in the area.
Review by - Yelp
Tom H.:
We stopped here for a quick bite and cocktail. I had the chicken and dumpling starter and it was fantastic. My wife had the shrimp and grits and it was excellent perfectly cooked. Both dishes were perfectly seasoned. Obviously a very good chef is in charge here.
Review by - Google
Jeff N.:
This is me and my wife's favorite place to eat in STL. It just so happens we also live in Oakville so we come all the time and have never once been disappointed. Can't wait to spend another Valentines Day here...

Our chef-driven menu is a combination of both the modern and classic Mexican kitchen. You’ll experience a menu with inspiration from Baja to Michoacan and everywhere in between. We understand the value that real ingredients bring to the table, that is why we take the time to make our sauces, salsas, marinades, meats and aiolis fresh in-house.
In step with the theme of our kitchen, the beverage program at El Milagro Azteca  is also inspired by the old and the new. Our back bar is filled with a curated list of artisan spirits from the US, Mexico, the Caribbean and beyond.
All of our craft cocktails are concocted with housemade syrups, fresh squeezed juices, fresh grown herbs and
Instagram-worthy garnishes.

Savor the Flavor of Authentic Mexican Cuisines
When you think of Mexican food, you probably imagine tacos, burritos, and fajitas. But it's
			more than that. Let Sabroso Cocina Mexicana in St. Ann, Missouri serve you delicious dishes
			that are particular to the various states of Mexico. Whether you want to dine in our
			restaurant or take your meal to go, our experienced servers will take care of you. You'll
			surely enjoy a unique dining experience with us!
About Us
Miguel has always had a vision of his own restaurant. He has been cooking since he was about
			ten years old. In Mexico, he learned from working with his mom. She has had a taco stand in
			Mexico City for over 40 years.
When the pandemic led to staffing cuts his friend and mentor made the tough decision to let
			him go but it was a blessing in disguise because he never stopped believing his vision would
			come to life and the time away from the corporate restaurant world gave him the inspiration
			and motivation to perfect his recipes and test the market by serving boxed lunches from his
			home kitchen.
That is how Sabroso was born. A box of business cards and some very loyal customers lead to
			the St Ann location where Miguel and his family and friends worked hard to bring this unique
			dining experience to the community. As always Miguel is planning for the future and we hope to
			bring more locations with more authentic foods to other parts of the St Louis Metro area.
Our Mission
To provide a culinary experience unlike any you've tried before. Education in Mexican culture
		through food.
Testimonials
âââââ
âGreat first time experience and restaurant! We found this new little neighborhood gem
						while searching for new restaurants in our area. I can say I agree with all of the other
						reviews that have been posted, that encouraged us to try it for the first time. The
						restaurant was clean inside and out. Covid protocols seem to be followed...
...Everything we had tasted delicious and the portion sizes were good. Again, I agree
							with what someone else posted about the mole. I lived 37 years in Southern California,
							and I can tell you that it is authentic. I wish we could've eaten inside, but one of
							us wasn't able to make it to the restaurant so we did a phone order and picke...â
- Ramona R.
âââââ
âThe food was excellent!! We got to sample different meats before we decided what to
						get. The owner was super nice and all the staff were friendly! Can't wait to come back
						and try more things!â
- Sarah G.
âââââ
âThis place is fantastic. With so many chain restaurants going in it was nice finding an
						authentic Mexican restaurant that was quick to order and receive so you had more time to
						savor the food. There were mexican dishes I had never heard of before that I insisted on
						trying and loved every single bite. Chef Miguel obviously has a passion for his craft
						and it shows. The staff were fantastic. I will be back soon.â

LEGEND
- Carry-out
Mexican cuisine is primarily a fusion of indigenous Mesoamerican cooking with European, especially Spanish, elements added after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire in the 16th century. The staples are native foods, such as corn, beans, avocados, tomatoes, and chili peppers, along with rice.

Dear Customers:
Don’t panic but be prepared for COVID-19. We practice good hygiene from hand washing to food
safety. My wife, Maya (from South Korea) and I would like to thank you for your support & trusting
us to prepare your meal. We been serving Nepalese, Indian & Korean cuisine in the city of St. Louis
since 2004.
I was born and raised in Manang, Nepal. When both parents passed away, I moved to Kathmandu
at age 16. In Kathmandu, I became homeless, because I was too young and could not find a job. I
remember every day, I was knocking on doors and looking for food in garbage cans. Many days, I
had nothing to eat. Many nights, I could not sleep, because of the fear of my safety and hunger. After
many months of my life struggles on the street of Kathmandu, I finally found a job at the KC
restaurant as a dishwasher & busboy. While I was working at the KC restaurant, I developed two
dreams. Dream of owning a restaurant and to help children who are poor and suffering as I was.
While I was working at the KC restaurant, I met Dr. James H. States, M.D. I had an opportunity to
come to the United States after my father, Dr. States adopted me in Nepal following his ascent of
Mt. Everest in 1983.
Chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes are the leading causes of death in the
City of St. Louis. I believe that diet is an important factor in preventing chronic diseases and
maintaining a healthy lifestyle. “The mission of Everest Café & Bar is to promote a healthy
lifestyle by preparing fresh heart-healthy nutritious meals for our customers”.
I completed my graduate education in social work and public health at Saint Louis University
(www.slu.edu). I worked many years in areas of chronic disease prevention and health promotion.
I believe that I have prepared myself to be the most qualified chef in today’s restaurant industry to
prepare heart-healthy & nutritious meals for my customers.
Again, thank you for trusting us to prepare your meal and supporting my dream. Your satisfaction
is my primary concern. If you have any questions or comments, please let me know. Because of
your support, Everest Café and Bar has been working to improve the health status of children and
women who are poor and suffering as I was. More information about our non-profit medical and
educational mission in Nepal, please visit us @ www.himalayanhealthmo.org
Best regards,
Dr. Devi Gurung States, DHSc., MPH., MSW.

Bombay Street Eats, You Will Lick Your Fingers Off

Baked With Lots of  Love
and Zero Cruelty
OUR STORY
We want to invite you to our family-owned Green kitchen based in our beloved city of St. Louis. Both of us grew up loving street eats from Bombay (aka Mumbai). We want to share the best comfort eats from Bombay and other parts of the world with our guests.
It's scientifically proven that Plant-based meals and a vegan lifestyle, in general, are not only good for our health but also for the health of our planet. At BFJ, we use fresh and local produce with authentic spices; spices that taste amazing and provide a wealth of health. Our meals are cooked with love and kindness in a hope that they will spread everywhere.
In 2013, we started our journey with the first-ever 100% vegetarian Indian food truck in St Louis. During these years, we have received a tremendous amount of Love and Support from the folks of STL. In 2020 we transitioned to a fully plant-based restaurant in Creve Coeur, MO.
​
W
e have faced and continue to face challenges that have made us stronger and resilient. We want to thank each and every one who gave us their love and support. We hope that St Louis will continue to support our mission toward sustainability and a smaller carbon footprint. If you are ever in the neighborhood, please stop by to check out the bright and inviting dining room and our unique menu.

This place has excellent food and staff. We went at a slower time in the day, and we were able to get our food quickly. The food is Vegan, and they have a ton of options that you wouldn't normally see for vegans. We ordered a ""chicken"" sandwich and ""chicken"" Tikka Naan wrap, which both came with fries. We got a slice of cheesecake and a Oatly milkshake later on. All in all, a great place to eat.
Jessica P.
from Yelp
Our friends raved about how good this place was and we had to try it! It was amazing! Everything was full of flavor and it was so yummy! I got the butter chicken bowl - WOW the flavors were exquisite! My fiancé got the chicken sandwich and loved it too! We shared a blueberry pie shake - another mind blower! So delicious! We'll definitely be coming back often!
Hemanth Krishnappa

Delicious!!! We had kachori chat, vada pav, pav bhaji, gobi & fried rice, masala fries and chai. Everything was delicious. Had to wait a little while for the order. Staff was courteous. Felt a bit expensive but understand vegan restaurants are a little expensive.
Overall a very good place!

Since 2005, we've helped thousands of people get the perfect domain name
D
Purchase of the domain was straightforward, and the negotiations were fair. Correspondence times were prompt and fast. I am giving four stars because if I had been able to get the price 10% lower, I feel I would've had a better deal. The delivery of the domain was quick and frictionless. I hope to buy again from HugeDomains in the future as the process was graceful and pleasant.

K
It was easy to purchase and link to official Google work account.
- Kerstin Pernilla Cedenheim, September 1, 2025
I
Positive and helpful email communication throughout the entire process of purchasing the selected domain, friendly dealings, we negotiated a discount of 200 USD (20% of the original price) from the original requested price for the purchased domain, with delivery of the domain within 24 hours. I highly recommend it. I would use the HugeDomains offer again!

What our customers say
Reviews
We got the Dumplings, House special egg foo young, House Special Lo Mein, and House special fried rice. Everything that we tried was delicious! It did not disappoint and I highly recommend it!
Cristina Gomez
Best crab rangoons in the city! Everything was ready fast and super hot. Got the Honey Chicken and the Orange Chicken. Both were delicious. The egg drop soup was good as well.
Shelby Johnson
This place has really great tasting, always hot, and super fresh food. My most recent order was a combination meal of Beef with Broccoli w/ pork fried rice and pork eggroll. The beef and broccoli were scrumptious, one of the best-tasting dishes I have had in years.
Monica J.
Good food selection and the price is comparatively cheaper than other Chinese restaurants. They do deliver. My favorites are General Tso's Chicken, Szechuan Slice Pork, Egg Drop with Wonton Soup, and Dumplings.
Sean T.
By far my favorite restaurant! You can order for pick up or have them delivered. Either way, you get your money's worth and it is delicious food! I have never had to wait long to get my order, and they are always punctual and polite.
Tony D.
I have gone to various Chinese food restaurants in the area. China King is by far the best tasting. Really good food. They are always really nice and welcoming when I get my take out here. Highly recommend them if you are getting Chinese takeout.

How Service Works
1. If you see a line, that means there's a wait so hop in! It generally moves quickly, so don't be scared.
2. Once you've entered, you'll be greeted by a team member who will direct you to your seats.
3. There is a self serve station in the front of the dining room, we suggest grabbing your water, utensils and napkins before you sit.
4. Once seated, you will use the QR code corresponding to your specific seat. It will direct you to our Square site where you can place your order and pay, then your food will arrive shortly thereafter.
5. Slurp up! While we are grateful for your patronage and want you to enjoy the food and atmosphere, please be mindful of your table time if there is a wait. NO MORE than 1 hour; the average Japanese person eats ramen in 5-10 minutes.
FAQs
Do you accommodate large parties?
â
We will do our best, but with only 24 total seats we strongly prefer groups of four or less. We cannot guarantee grouped seating for anything larger.
Do I need a reservation?
â
No reservations, walk-ins only. Ramen shops are like diners, very casual.
Do you offer takeout or delivery?
Dine-in only. To-go ramen is virtually non-existent in Japan as it does not carry well.
Do you have any vegetarian/vegan/gluten-free options?
No, all of our entree dishes contain meat/seafood products as well as wheat noodles.

Fufu
Fufu is an African staple that is served throughout the continent. Culturally, fufu is similar to a family recipe with a famous ingredient that makes it their own. Every country in Africa has its own way of making fufu that individualizes the dish and makes it personal to the location you are in. The consistency of fufu is closest to mashed potato, although a bit firmer, and our fufu is cooked with plantain and yam flour. Fufu is meant to be used to scoop up your stew or other entree.
Jollof Rice
Jollof rice is another staple dish served in West Africa. It is white rice cooked in a tomato-based sauce with our West African curry, garlic, and ginger. Jollof rice is often served at celebrations, festivals, and gatherings, and there's a friendly rivalry among West African countries about who makes the best jollof rice, leading to many debates and competitions. We think you’ll find ours to be a contender!
Entrees
All entrees come with your choice of side - Fufu or Jollof rice.
Beef Stew
Our Beef Stew is slow-cooked to bring out deep, robust flavors. Tender chunks of beef are steeped in a rich tomato base, infused with garlic, ginger, and African spices. This classic West African dish is bold and warming, making it a satisfying staple with a hint of spice.
Oxtail in Palm Nut Stew
Our Beef Stew is slow-cooked to bring out deep, robust flavors. Tender chunks of beef are steeped in a rich tomato base, infused with garlic, ginger, and African spices. This classic West African dish is bold and warming, making it a satisfying staple with a hint of spice.
Egusi
A beloved West African stew, Egusi is a savory blend of ground melon seeds, leafy greens, and spices simmered to perfection. This hearty dish is rich in flavor and texture, offering a nutty taste that’s perfect for scooping with FUFU. Every bite is a comforting reminder of home and tradition.
Beef Suya
Spicy, smoky, and irresistibly flavorful, our Beef Suya is West African street food at its finest. Thinly sliced beef is seasoned with a rich, peanut-based suya spice mix and grilled to perfection, delivering a tantalizing taste of African spice in every bite. Suya lovers, this one’s for you!
Chicken Suya
A delicious twist on traditional suya, our Chicken Suya is marinated in our Suya Spice, a bold peanut and chili spice mix, then grilled to juicy perfection. Packed with smoky heat and a hint of sweetness, this West African favorite is perfect for those who love a burst of flavor with every bite.
Tofu Suya
For a plant-based twist on a classic, our Tofu Suya is marinated in a signature suya spice blend made with ground peanuts and chili, then grilled for that perfect smoky flavor. This West African-inspired skewer is bursting with spice and warmth, ideal for vegans and suya lovers alike.
Pepper Goat
For those who love bold flavors and a spicy kick, our Pepper Goat is a must-try! Tender goat meat is cooked in a fiery pepper sauce, seasoned with African spices that pack just the right amount of heat. It’s a vibrant dish that brings warmth and excitement to every bite.
Zo-Zo Wings
Our Zo-Zo Chicken Wings bring a fiery West African twist to a beloved favorite. Marinated in a special blend of African spices and herbs, these wings are grilled to juicy perfection with a crisp, flavorful coating that delivers a spicy, smoky kick. Perfect for sharing (or not)!
Goat Pepper Soup
Warm up with our Goat Pepper Soup, a spicy and aromatic broth with tender pieces of goat meat that melt in your mouth. This West African classic is a staple for gatherings, offering a bold kick of spice and warmth that lingers in the best way.
Fish Stew
A coastal delight, our Fish Stew is crafted with fresh golden pompano simmered in a vibrant tomato and pepper sauce, infused with African spices. Inspired by West Africa’s coastal cuisines, it’s a taste of the sea and the spice that transports you right to the shores.
Sides
Fufu
Soft, smooth, and made for dipping! FUFU is a classic West African accompaniment, made from cassava or yam, kneaded to perfection for a smooth, stretchy texture. Perfectly paired with stews or soups, it's a staple that brings together families around the table.
Jollof Rice
A West African treasure known for its vibrant, spicy tomato base, Jollof Rice is a colorful plate of fluffy, flavorful rice that dances with bell peppers, onions, and aromatic spices. Each spoonful is a taste of home, joy, and celebration across Africa, uniting communities with its unforgettable flavor.
Beignets
Light, fluffy, and dusted with powdered sugar, our Beignets are a delightful twist on a beloved West African-inspired treat. Each bite of these pillowy, sweet pastries melts in your mouth, perfect with a cup of tea or coffee for a moment of pure indulgence.
Fried Plantains
Golden and deliciously caramelized, our Fried Plantains are a West African staple, offering a sweet and savory treat with every bite. With their crispy edges and soft centers, they’re the perfect complement to any meal, adding a taste of home and warmth to every plate.
Black Eyed Peas Au Jus
A soulful embrace of black-eyed peas simmered in a savory, slow-cooked broth, rich with herbs and spices. This comforting dish channels the heart of West African cuisine, where simplicity and depth come together to create a nourishing staple with every bite.
Beverages
Ginger Tea
Bold and warming, our Ginger Tea is a soothing blend with a gentle spice that awakens the senses. This West African favorite is brewed with fresh ginger root known for its health benefits and comforting heat blended with a refreshing pineapple juice making it the perfect drink for a cozy moment of relaxation.
Hibiscus Tea
Refreshing and beautifully vibrant, our Hibiscus Tea is brewed from sun-dried hibiscus flowers, offering a slightly tangy and floral taste. Known as “zobo” or “bissap” in West Africa, this deep red tea is as revitalizing as it is rich in tradition and culture.
Chicken Yassa
A West African classic, Chicken Yassa features tender chicken marinated in a zesty blend of lemon, mustard, and spices, then slow-cooked with caramelized onions for a deeply savory, tangy taste. This dish is a beautiful balance of bold, bright flavors that dance on the palate with every bite.

Hanna, my daughter, was diagnosed with Celiac disease in 2005 at the age of 7. One of the first goals after we
opened our first restaurant was to provide quality, delicious, gluten-free food, and, more importantly, to educate our
staff about what being ""gluten-free"" really means. We are very proud of what we have created and even more proud
of the staff that stands behind it. Years later, ALL restaurants in our OG Hospitality Group offer great gluten-free
menus. And Hanna, now a bona fide food-diva, has had a hand in all of it. (At least she thinks she does!)
So why gluten-free? We don't do it because the competition is doing it across the street. And we don’t do it because its
a fad or something we’re required to do. We do it because we live it everyday and understand all too well the
challenges of going out to eat and finding delicious, healthy gluten-free options.
If you have questions regarding our gluten-free menu or comments or suggestions of things you like or dislike, please
email me at glutenfree@oghgstl.com.

Love your enemy
The mission of Have A Cow is to foster connection and provide opportunity
for folks from different backgrounds to come together, break down cultural
barriers and serve one another.
Growing up kids used to say, “Don’t have a cow, man!” meaning don’t get
all excited about something. But we want you to HAVE A COW! We want
you to get excited! And specifically we want folks to get excited about
getting to know each other, serving each other and even loving each
other - even if we’re from very different backgrounds - even if we consider
each other enemies.

About the Business
SqWires is proud to be a 5-star certified Green Dining Alliance member. We support local - we buy ingredients & products that are local, organic & responsibly raised. We also recycle, compost & re-purpose. SqWires is proud to support this wonderful historic Lafayette Square neighborhood - we sponsor concerts, movies & annual house tours. SqWires is a St. Louis ""EatLocal"" member - thank you for supporting independent restaurants.

SqWires is a handsome redesign of a 19th-century brick structure, part of a Victorian-era factory complex. The former Western Wire manufacturing buildings, located on an entire city block in historic Lafayette Square, originally housed the American Bed Factory. In 2001, the complex was totally renovated & converted to house SqWires Restaurant, plus 80 business & residential lofts. The name SqWires combines its location in the Square & history of the Western Wire factory.

SqWires Annex & Front Room are perfect for your next event. Rehearsal dinners, weddings, receptions, holiday parties, business meetings - we would love to help you. Give us a call or email info@sqwires.com.

About the Business
No Ordinary Rabbit is a neighborhood restaurant serving a menu of shareable plates [family style, not tapas!] inspired by eastern Mediterranean cuisine. We hope to provide a menu that is diverse and fun as well as approachable. Come to The Rabbit with the intent of passing plates around and enjoying bits of everything. A unique wine list pairs wonderfully with the food we serve and there is something for everyone, even if you don’t know what you want to have. The cocktails are inspired by the food and the region, but aren’t limited to the ingredients of the Mediterranean. The Rabbit crew is ready to guide you to a joyful experience are excited to answer questions and make suggestions. We just want to deliver the best possible experience with as little pretense as possible. Please, come give us a try!

Fall
2022
Fall Menu
For centuries, Japanese fisherman of the Tsugaru Strait have known July to January is the best time to catch Bluefin Tuna as schools of the predatory fish migrate to the rough, cold waters in search of squid.
Guided by tradition and sustainable practices, Chef Nobu sources fish from around the worldâfrom the abalone and mussels prized by Chumash Indians off the Central California coast to the Yellowtail of Miyazaki Prefecture in Japan.
Our selections reflect the seasonal rhythms of the sea and field. The freshest seafood is not merely that which as been caught recently, but that which is harvested according to the cycles of the natural world.
Our menu inorporates shin-shoga (fresh ginger from Kochi prefecture, Japan), takenoko (bamboo from Kumamoto, prefecture) and shungiku (Garland Chrysanthemum greens).
RESERVATIONS AREÂ currently unavailable. We will open limited seating for soft openings in early October.

Notice: consuming raw or under cooked meat, poultry, fish or eggs may increase the risk of foodborne illness.
Hanna, my daughter, was diagnosed with Celiac disease in 2005 at the age of 7. One of the first goals after we
opened our first restaurant was to provide quality, delicious, gluten-free food, and, more importantly, to educate our
staff about what being ""gluten-free"" really means. We are very proud of what we have created and even more proud
of the staff that stands behind it. Years later, ALL restaurants in our OG Hospitality Group offer great gluten-free
menus. And Hanna, now a bona fide food-diva, has had a hand in all of it. (At least she thinks she does!)
So why gluten-free? We don't do it because the competition is doing it across the street. And we don’t do it because its
a fad or something we’re required to do. We do it because we live it everyday and understand all too well the
challenges of going out to eat and finding delicious, healthy gluten-free options.
If you have questions regarding our gluten-free menu or comments or suggestions of things you like or dislike, please
email me at glutenfree@oghgstl.com.

Hawaiian Food is Ono!
Welcome to Buzz's Hawaiian Grill's menu. Buzz's specializes in authentic
Hawaiian plate lunch
dishes. The plate lunch is quintessentially a modern Hawaiian meal.
Modern day Hawaiians grow up eating
plate lunches
, and if a tourist is lucky enough they will stumble upon a hole-in-the-wall establishment that offers them. Plate lunches were derived from sugarcane and pineapple plantation workers sharing their homeland's food. The plantation workers came to the islands from all over the globe and mostly from China, Japan, Okinawa, Philippines, Portugal, Cuba, and Korea. Another huge influence on the Hawaiian food scene came from the missionaries who traveled from the New England states to bring Christianity and lastly the cowboys from Mexico.
Their homeland recipes were modified to accommodate the available resources of the Hawaiian Islands. These modified recipes created variations of the original dishes making it impossible to obtain their unique flavors outside Hawaii. For instance, there are dishes the Chinese swear are of Japanese heritage, while the same dish is claimed to be Chinese influence by someone from Japan. Bottom line is the dish has become modern day Hawaiian.
Narrowing down which dishes Buzz's should offer was and is a difficult task. What we ultimately elected to do was rotate our menu offering all the dishes our family loves, but at different times. This means not all the ono Hawaiian dishes below are served daily. It also means our daily menu is packed with tasty surprises.  Simply put, not all of our dishes will fit on our truck bradda.

REINVENTING
Barbecue
EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.
When we first decided to team up to start our barbecue joint in a strip mall, we hesitated a little at the location; wedged between a copy center and a pet store. I mean, where would the smoker go? It turns out, it was the perfect place to launch our BBQ baby that’s gained fans in St. Louis and awards far beyond. Since 2012, Sugarfire Smokehouse has combined Carolyn’s incredible desserts and Mike’s talent for all things smoked and meaty. Now we’re expanding our reach to share our creations with our favorite cities.
Sincerely,
Chef Mike & Chef Carolyn
