Business Owner
Established in 2019. Drew and I met at Copper Onion over 10 years ago. We dated for 8 years and got married. We both knew we wanted to own a restaurant and here we are! Building our life and dream together. We’ve been researching spaces for years and this one finally became available. We began the remodel in October of 2018 and opened on February 26, 2019. Oquirrh is the mountain range to the west. We chose the name Oquirrh because of our love for mountains. Wasatch is always used and Oquirrh not as much and we watch these amazing sunsets everyday..

Do you take reservations?
Sorry, our tables are first come, first serve. You may be seated when your entire party arrives. If you have a large party you may call ahead and we will do our best to accommodate you. Our peak hours are from 11:30-1, so you may consider coming at an off time if you have a large group. We do rent our space Mon-Thursday from 6:30 pm-10. Hourly charge plus food purchase minimum required.
How much is catering  per person?
As each event is different it is extremely hard to give you an estimate until we have more information. If you can give us a general guest count and either budget or an idea of the kind of menu you would like (finger foods, salad buffet, full dinner/entrees), then we are happy to get you an estimate. The best way to do that is to email platesandpalates@msn.com  Our catering menus are structured differently than most. Our menu items come in certain quantities, such as bowls of salad, 9x12 pans of entrees, sheets of dessert bars, so it is not a per person charge. We can help you over the phone for pick up or delivery orders for under 100 guests. For events larger than 100 guests we can help you via email or phone with menus/questions. We have coordinated many events from afar if you are not local. We can generally work with most budgets
How can I book my event?
After we have menu selections and a very rough guest count, we will give you an estimate. If the estimate is agreeable to you, we will then take a NON-REFUNDABLE deposit,  and then your event will be booked. Your date is NOT saved until we have a menu and deposit.  We can
slightly fine tune
the quantities/ guest count within 10 days. Increasing the order/guest count can be difficult for us so please shoot a little high on guest estimate.
What catering services do you offer?
We offer pick up or drop off on disposable serving dishes. Payment in full is due 2 days before any delivery.  We are no longer offering full offsite service with staff/servers.

Today is Mardi Gras (AKA Fat Tuesday)
This is our busiest day of the year!  Live music, killer food and cocktails, face painting and more!
In order to give our guests the best possible experience we may have to disable to-go orders during our dinner rush.
If you are unable to checkout this is because we are unable to handle any more orders at the moment.
You can either come join us in person or hopefully wait a while and once we are back under control we will enable on-line to go orders again.
During this time we may be unable to answer the phones as well so please bear with us.
Laissez les bons temps rouler!

Athletic Brewing Athletic Lite
6
Athletic Lite is a light brew, completely reimagined. Its classically simple but expertly crafted with 25 calories, 5 carbs, and organic grains. We brewed it specifically for the sport of life and all the good times that come with it.
Athletic Brewing Cerveza Athletica
6
Atlética is a refreshingly bright take on a Mexican-style copper. Using the finest Munich malts, it boasts a lightly toasted malt character with a whisper of spicy florals before rolling into smooth and lightly sweet waves of bread crust and wheat. A medium-body brew that is big in flavor, its the epitome of easy drinking. A smooth and satisfying cooler must-have.
Athletic Brewing Free Wave Hazy IPA
6
Our Free Wave Hazy IPA is meant for the open road. Whether youre cruising the Pacific Coast Highway in a convertible or tracing your way up the coast on your bike, our Free Wave doesnt cut corners. This mouth watering IPA is loaded with Amarillo, Citra, and Mosaic hops. Show Less
Athletic Brewing Run Wild IPA
6
The ultimate session-able IPA. Brewed with a blend of Northwest hops with Citra and Mosaic at the forefront. Body of premium organic malts from US & Germany. Subtle yet complex malt profile.
Athletic Brewing Upside Dawn
6
Refreshing, clean, balanced, light-bodied. Aromas subtle with floral and earthy notes. Brewed with premium organic malts from US & Germany along with combo of English and traditional American hops to the golden ale style. 50 Calories.
Bayou Lemonade
5
House lemonade with fresh muddled mint. Garnished with mint.
Best Day Brewing Hazy IPA
6
We founded this company with the sole mission of creating genuine craft beers, that were also non-alcoholic. Our non-alcoholic Hazy IPA is that mission in spades. Honeyed amber in color, it has a strong hop-forward aroma with hints of resinous pine and grapefruit. Its luscious medium body has a smooth, complex citrus flavor with a full and lively mouthfeel and a dry finish. Finally, a non-alcoholic craft beer for real craft beer drinkers.
Best Day Brewing Kolsh
6
The complement to the Hazy had to be easy-drinking, approachable, and low calorie, yet full of flavor and authenticity. We used a combination of Cologne and Pilsner malts and Hallertau Traditional hops to create a refreshingly complex Kolsch-style ale. Its sturdy caramel malt flavor is perfectly balanced by the citrusy hops, leaving a bright and crisp finish. The quintessential embodiment of ""ALL DAY. EVERY DAY.""
Best Day Brewing West Coast IPA
6
Our non-alcoholic West Coast IPA is a tribute to our back yard and its rich history of making damn good beers. Its Cascade hops are an ode to the beers that started the IPA revolution. The rich malt backbone provides ample structure for the grapefruit Cascade notes to shine. Drink up, get out there.

Gruvi Dry Secco Alcohol-Free
7
Delicate, floral and semi-dry with a touch of tartness, this alcohol-free sparkling prosecco is Gruvi's most popular bev for a reason.
Gruvi Non-Alcoholic Dry Red Blend
8
This alcohol removed Red Blend is a weeknight winner. It also won some actual hardware, taking a silver medal at the International Wine & Spirits Competition for its pleasantly dry, full-bodied taste, and rich notes of cranberry, cherry, savory cardamom and nutmeg.
Gruvi Non-Alcoholic Sangria
8
This alcohol removed Sangria may look like sparkling wine, but its actually solid gold. Thats right, this uncompromising bev earned top honor at the International Wine and Spirits Competition. Bright notes of blood orange, red currant and blueberry are perfectly balanced with a warm touch of cinnamon and clove; its the not-too-sweet Spanish bev thats always down for m?s good times.

The Bayou App
We are Utah's largest beer bar and have the best selection of beers in the region. You simply will not find a better selection of beers available anywhere in Utah.  We feature many local Microbreweries on our 36 tap draft system and have an extensive selection of beers in the bottle.
With a beer list now reaching into the many hundred, it can be overwhelming to find a beer you want.  To solve this problem, The Bayou released the first and still only beer app for any Utah bar.  Our app's beer list is updated in real time and allows filtering, sorting, and searching for beers in many ways.  You can even give your phone a shake for a random beer selection.

Michael F:
My family had this restaurant rented out for our Christmas party. The first thing I wanted to say and give credit to is the food is fantastic! The staff was very polite and nice and was very helpful when we needed more tables when more people showed up than we expected. Thank you very much Café Madrid!!!

Heather K:
Cafe Madrid never disappoints. The food is excellent. I had the chicken marsala last night and easily give it 5 stars. The marsala sauce is absolutely perfect. My husband had the pork chops and said they were the best he had ever had. They were perfectly cooked and the mustard sauce with them was delicious. The service is wonderful. We always had drinks full, food served just as ready and much attention given to us. It is a perfect place to go for a special ocassion or date night.

100% vegan deliciousness. Made from scratch in Salt Lake City.
About Us
We’ve been slinging vegan sandwiches in Salt Lake City since 2012. Our little sandwich shop was born out of a deep love for animals and our passion for plant-based eating.
Everything we serve is made in-house, including all of our proteins and sauces. We are grateful to serve accessible, nutrient dense and affordable vegan meals to the community around us.

Q:
This place sounds like quite an experience, BUT I don't like the idea of not knowing the price. Until I can see some pricing then I don't think I will go. Can anyone give me an idea for a meal for 1 or 2?
A:
$15 a person is pretty standard, goes up from there if you get seafood

Out of all the choices of breweries that get thrown at you when searching for them in Salt Lake City, this is the one to choose. Great atmosphere, large selection of unique beers, and the food is delicious. You’re welcome.
C.Watts
Love this place. Not a drinker, but the food is great and they have some fun local sodas to try. The bratwurst is great (amazing sauerkraut), and the pastrami sandwich was to die for! Super cool vibe. Great place to watch fight night. :)
Stacie Graves
I can’t say enough about this place. Excellent beer and the Rueben was phenomenal. We also sampled a bunch of the appetizers and all were so yummy! Great place with enough parking downtown
Annie Thomas
Really clean and fun pub. Staff was all so fantastic and friendly. We ate so much good food, and had awesome beers. We were able to eat, enjoy beers and laugh and felt so comfortable. So happy to have found this place while in town visiting family.

When was Mole first created?
Mole is the Mexican national dish for holidays and feasts. But how and when was mole first created? Among the common folklore of its creation includes a tale from the early colonial period. According to the legend, upon hearing that the archbishop was going to visit the Convent of Santa Rosa in Puebla, the nuns were in a panic because they were poor and had nothing to prepare. They prayed about the situation and brought together the little bits of what they had to make a sauce. This included peppers, spices, day-old bread, nuts, and a little chocolate. They served the sauce on top of some turkey and the Archbishop loved it!
Holy Moley!
Red Iguana is famous for our moles (pronounced moh-lays) and we have at least 8 different types that are available regularly — Mole Negro, Amarillo, Poblano, Verde, Coloradito, Red Pipian, Mango, and Almendras. If you’d like to sample each mole currently available, ask your waiter for a mole sampler (seen below).
During his visit to the Red Iguana, Diner’s, Drive-ins, and Dives host, Guy Fieri exclaimed, “Holy Moley!” while helping owner Lucy Cardenas add ingredients to a giant vat of mole.
Old World Style Wall
For the main wall feature in the patio area of Red Iguana 2, designers used an old-world style of construction that combines mixed materials like stone, bricks, and mortar, while also incorporating found objects such as driftwood, sandstone, glass bottles, and cobblestone. How many different items can you spot in this unique architectural feature?
TABLE 45
You may find that the tables at the original Red Iguana location are placed close together, giving your dining experience a “lively” appeal. However, couples seeking a romantic moment can ask for Table 45, a quiet table for two, tucked in a small alcove at the center of the restaurant.",YES

All Testimonial
This is my second time coming here. It did not disappoint. I had the #1 three taco combo with 16 oz beverage. I chose Al Pastor Style. The tacos were delicious and the sauce that came with them enhanced the flavor. Additionally, I ordered chips with salsa. The portions were perfect and filling. The service was impeccable. I will return to this restaurant again. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for authentic taste that is not a chain restaurant.
Edward Krohn

Painting of Xochitonal
Watch this time-lapse video showing Utah artist Stephen Kesler painting Xochitonal.
When was Mole first created?
Mole is the Mexican national dish for holidays and feasts. But how and when was mole first created? Among the common folklore of its creation includes a tale from the early colonial period. According to the legend, upon hearing that the archbishop was going to visit the Convent of Santa Rosa in Puebla, the nuns were in a panic because they were poor and had nothing to prepare. They prayed about the situation and brought together the little bits of what they had to make a sauce. This included peppers, spices, day-old bread, nuts, and a little chocolate. They served the sauce on top of some turkey and the Archbishop loved it!
Holy Moley!
Red Iguana is famous for our moles (pronounced moh-lays) and we have at least 8 different types that are available regularly — Mole Negro, Amarillo, Poblano, Verde, Coloradito, Red Pipian, Mango, and Almendras. If you’d like to sample each mole currently available, ask your waiter for a mole sampler (seen below).
During his visit to the Red Iguana, Diner’s, Drive-ins, and Dives host, Guy Fieri exclaimed, “Holy Moley!” while helping owner Lucy Cardenas add ingredients to a giant vat of mole.
Old World Style Wall
For the main wall feature in the patio area of Red Iguana 2, designers used an old-world style of construction that combines mixed materials like stone, bricks, and mortar, while also incorporating found objects such as driftwood, sandstone, glass bottles, and cobblestone. How many different items can you spot in this unique architectural feature?
TABLE 45
You may find that the tables at the original Red Iguana location are placed close together, giving your dining experience a “lively” appeal. However, couples seeking a romantic moment can ask for Table 45, a quiet table for two, tucked in a small alcove at the center of the restaurant.",NO

What is a Torta?
A torta is a broad class of Mexican sandwich that is usually offered with many different choices of filling. A torta should weigh roughly the amount of Infinite Jest (paperback is fine), and you should be completely covered in it after just a few bites.” Tortas are so huge and messy that you really shouldn’t eat them in the company of those who would be scandalized by you licking your fingers (and hands and possibly arms) while you eat.
This torta photo has chicken and beef milanesa (meat, usually beef, pounded thin, breaded, and fried), tomatoes, avocado, lettuce, jalapeno, and cheese. And of course there is mayo on it. In case you weren’t keeping count, that’s all of the good things stacked between two halves of a special hoagie roll that are gloriously toasted and just substantial enough to mostly hold your sandwich together until you’re almost done, but not so substantial you can’t bite through it cleanly. The meats vary from sandwich to sandwich, but the condiments pretty much stay the same. Before you eat, as if all that weren’t enough, you slather that piece of awesomeness with freshly-made chipotle salsa.

What people say
ABOUT US AND OUR FOOD
You’re gonna spend $12.00 on a torta but the amount of food you get will feed you for two meals no problem. Absolutely loaded with meats and cheese. I usually hate chipotle sauce but I loved it from Big Tortas. 10/10 can’t wait to go back.
Joshua Petrie
Wonderful experience. The tacos are huge. My first time I ordered twice the number of tacos I thought I could eat. The lady at the register was SUPER nice and genuinely happy to be there. Plenty of seating, parking and very clean. Definitely coming back.
Jordan Knight
This place is delicious, tortas are huge and yummy. If you try the “Marinera” (it has shrimp) you’re not gonna be disappointed. Tacos are also a really good choice, “carnitas” “suadero” “lengua” “arrachera” whichever you choose will be a good option.

Excellent Columbia restaurant!! I had the Encanto burger, and it was sweet and salty. It was fantastic! The passion fruit drink is amazing. I will come back.

Encanto is a true culinary gem. Its unique decor sets it apart from other Colombian restaurants, creating a warm and special atmosphere. The food is a solid 10 out of 10, with authentic and well-executed flavors. The burgers are outstanding, featuring the best quality, juicy meat. The stuffed arepas are absolutely delicious. Highly recommended!

Our Story
La Fountain Mexican Restaurant was established in Utah in 2009 by the Ramos Brothers, who migrated from San Luis Potosi, Mexico to Utah. The hard-working and dedicated brothers worked for more than 15 years and decided to unite efforts and savings to open their first restaurant in West Valley City, initiating the achievement of their American Dream.
Their unique efforts, great service, and amazing Mexican food were well accepted by the locals and this allowed them to open a second location in Tooele a year later in 2010. In 2012 they were able to once again expand and established two new locations in Riverton and Sandy, Utah. Their success was noticed by other entrepreneurs and through a strategic partnership, two more locations were open, in Salt Lake City and Lehi, Utah. At the beginning of 2018, West Valley City welcomed its second La Fountain Mexican Restaurant on Decker Lake Ln. Next to the Maverick Center making this the seventh La Fountain in the State of Utah
To this date, and with much success, each of the Ramos brothers and their families is still seen in their restaurants managing, serving, cooking, welcoming and working hard every day.

WHEAT / WEIZEN / WIT
Wheat is higher in protein than the barley favored by brewers, which aids in the head retention and body of beer. American wheat styles are cleaner tasting with a light grainy flavor, while German Hefeweizens are favored for the banana/bubble gum and clove flavors produced by the yeast. Belgians call these beers âWit Beerâ meaning white and are brewed with orange peel and coriander. Specialty malts may be added for darker richer beers with notes of banana-nut bread, vanilla, and raisin.

Rooster- Honey Wheat Ale
10
Templin Family- Ethereal Leichte Weisse

Wasatch- Blueberry Hefeweizen
BELGIAN
These beers are brewed using a Belgian yeast strain which produces high levels of fruity esters and peppery phenols. These beers are similar in flavor to German Hefeweizens but typically do not contain wheat. Highly carbonated and very dry, these are refreshing, zesty beers with ba-nana/clove notes in the lighter styles and plum/raisin in darker styles.

WHEAT / WEIZEN / WIT
Wheat is higher in protein than the barley favored by brewers, which aids in the head retention and body of beer. American wheat styles are cleaner tasting with a light grainy flavor, while German Hefeweizens are favored for the banana/bubble gum and clove flavors produced by the yeast. Belgians call these beers âWit Beerâ meaning white and are brewed with orange peel and coriander. Specialty malts may be added for darker richer beers with notes of banana-nut bread, vanilla, and raisin.

Rooster- Honey Wheat Ale

Templin Family- Ethereal Leichte Weisse

Wasatch- Blueberry Hefeweizen
BELGIAN
These beers are brewed using a Belgian yeast strain which produces high levels of fruity esters and peppery phenols. These beers are similar in flavor to German Hefeweizens but typically do not contain wheat. Highly carbonated and very dry, these are refreshing, zesty beers with ba-nana/clove notes in the lighter styles and plum/raisin in darker styles.

Mumbai House Customer
Sanjay Bhat
Was wondering why Bombay (Mumbai) House was always in 1st place whenever I googled best Indian restaurants in SLC! Now I know why-the lamb dhaba and the chicken curry were delicious and the visit was made even more pleasant by Naysan our server who was always smiling and very attentive in spite of being so busy! Worth a visit!

Was looking for a good place to eat while on Vacation in Salt Lake City and I found it!! I stopped at The Bombay House Salt Lake City location on a Monday night after reading great reviews

I visited Utah on business, and I asked around for some good Indian restaurants. There were a lot of places recommended, but my local coworkers suggested Bombay (Mumbai) House.

Patrick and his team performed flawlessly. Very happy with the premium domain name we bought and the price we paid for it. People who complain about this company do not understand that a company is only responsible for the services it describes and commits to. HugeDomains can and should be trusted as a major player in the domain sales market.

Easy and efficient. Was worried about all of the bad reviews...we experienced none of that. If you need a site they have I would recommend without hesitation. They had the site we needed and bought it. Perfect...end of story.

Q: Which pho is free of MSG?
The Vegetarian Pho is the only one that is MSG-free. However, you can always request any of the other pho combinations to be made with the vegetarian broth.
Q: What are some of the most popular pho combinations that you recommend?
– #13 Pho if you DO NOT like fat in your steak
– #18 Pho if you DO like fat in your steak
– #16 Pho if you’re feeling adventurous and want to try textured meats like tripe (stomach lining, chewy texture) and tendon (ligament, gelatin texture)
Q: I don’t like my meat rare, should I still order the rare steak?
The rare steak is only rare before it hits the broth. Once it arrives to your table, it should be finished cooking. It usually cooked to about medium well. If you are concerned, you can request for it to be extra cooked.
Q: What are your vegetarian or vegan options?
– Our #20 Pho is vegetarian and vegan-friendly
– A tofu substitution can be requested for our Fried Eggrolls appetizer or the Vermicelli Bowl entree (This is vegetarian-friendly, but not vegan)
– A tofu substitution can be requested for our Spring Rolls appetizers. Please allow for a longer wait to fry the tofu (This option is both vegetarian and vegan friendly)
Q: What are your gluten-free options?
– All of our pho combinations are gluten-free, except for any that has the meatballs
– Our Spring Rolls are gluten-free. BUT the sweet brown sauce that comes with them is NOT. Please request the fish sauce if you have a gluten intolerance
– Hoisin and soy sauce are NOT gluten-free
Q: I ordered pho and received a vegetable plate, what do I do with it?
The vegetable plate is for your Pho, everything is optional to use:
– Bean sprouts are for a crispy texture
– Thai basil (only use the leaves) extracts a minty/licorice flavor into the broth
– Lime or lemon wedges are for a sour flavor
– Jalapeños are for spice
Q: What are the sauces on my table?
– The red bottle is Sriracha: Spicy
– The brown bottle is Hoisin: Sweet & salty
– The silver tin is Chili Oil: Smokey & spicy
(You can also request soy sauce & concentrated fish sauce with us)

It was very good , I had the chicken soup with dumplings at medium spice and I got a side of rice to add bc it was too spicy for me but adding the rice to the soup was so delish. Cute little place with nice staff. Very yummy dumplings

Nathan P:
We are very pleased to have discovered this place. My wife got the Fried Mango Chicken dumplings and I got the Steamed Pork. Both were fantastic. We'll be back to try their other dumplings and their other dishes. Their cakes looked delicious but we were too full for any.

The Utah craft beer scene is booming and nobody represents the full spectrum of Utah’s best craft beers than Red Rock Brewery in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah.
Red Rock Brewery opened its doors on March 14, 1994.  From the very beginning, we set out to brew high-quality craft beers and serve delicious food.
Red Rock Brewery has earned a national reputation as one of the most creative breweries in the country. Our beers have received more than 100 regional and national awards and our restaurant has been named ‘Brewpub of the Year’ by
Brewpub Magazine
and ‘Large Brewpub of the Year’ by the
Great American Beer Festival
.
Locally, the original brewpub has become a staple of Salt Lake City’s
downtown dining
scene. Red Rock has opened additional restaurants at
Fashion Place Mall
in Murray, Utah, and in Kimball Junction near the resort community of Park City, Utah.
Our
Park City restaurant
features a taproom to watch the game while you have a local craft beer. Our curated
menus
offer the best steak, wood-fired pizza, seafood, pasta, burgers, salads, small bites, and dessert, as well as a full liquor and wine menu.
All locations offer to-go food for
takeout and delivery
. We are committed to maintaining the highest health and cleanliness standards in our dining rooms.
In 2011, we expanded our brewing capacity with a dedicated production
brewery
to support our restaurant growth and to expand the availability of
our beers
to local pubs and retail locations.
We produce more than 30 core, seasonal, and special release brands of beer that can be purchased either directly from the
Red Rock beer store
, at Utah State Liquor stores, at our restaurants, Harmon’s Grocery stores, and many other locations throughout Utah.
Stop into the
Red Rock Beer Store
and find seasonal and limited-release beers.
Red Rock Brewing Company has brewed the best beer in Salt Lake City and has been your favorite lunch, brunch, and dinner spot for 27 years!
Cheers!

About the Business
Business owner information
Scott A.
Business Owner
The Tavernacle Social Club has been Salt Lake City's most wild dueling piano show for over 11 years!

A dueling piano show is like a great big sing-along. Two piano players sit facing each other at baby grand pianos.

The 'dueling' part of a dueling piano show comes from YOU, the audience. You determine what you want to hear by filling out request slips provided at each table. Bring your request slip up to either of the pianists, accompanied by a tip. The size of the tip determines how badly you want to hear the song. 

NOTE: The amount of money on the song determines its priority in the lineup of requests. 

If someone else in the audience doesn't want to hear your favorite song, they can stop it for a dollar more than it was requested for... but you can start the song again for one dollar more. Let the duel begin.

We encourage singing, clapping, and even a little dancing on the piano if it's your special day. Come join us for a rockin' good time with our dueling piano shows

To our guests with food sensitivities, allergies or special dietary needs, our restaurants prepare and serve products that contain peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, eggs, milk, soy and gluten. Regular kitchen operations involve shared cooking and preparation areas, and food variations may occur due to differences in suppliers, ingredient substitutions, recipe revisions, and/or preparation at the restaurant. For these reasons, we cannot guarantee that any menu item will be completely free of allergens.

About Nomad Eatery
True to itâs name, Nomad Eatery has wandered its way to the Uinta Brewhouse Pub, and weâre luckier for it. Chef Vance Lott slows down the fast casual dining experience and bring you everything from classic sandwiches, burgers and wings to his own take on the classic pub chips. We call it sophisticated pub food, youâll just call it delicious.

For the last 20 years, there’s one thing we’ve never changed— every sauce is made in-house, our chicken is fresh-cut and marinated, every veggie is freshly cut and prepped daily. We’ve spent two decades sourcing breads and meats from top-quality producers, ensuring they’re crafted to our exact proprietary recipes. At Spitz, freshness and quality aren’t just priorities—they’re our main recipe, our secret recipe, the only recipe we’ll never change.

From Our Family to Yours
In Mount Salem, Jamaica, lived a family of 11, who were raised by an amazing woman: Florence Harding. Chef, mother, grandmother, and sole provider, Florence worked 7 days a week preparing fresh meals for the Chin & Changs, (a Jamaican-Chinese family who migrated to Jamaica in the late 1940’s). Florence worked hard, until her hands callused, yet when her shift ended, she rushed back home to tend to her family pot. Upon arrival, Florence would light the coal burning stove while granddaughter Sheron Grant, (head chef of 11Hauz), would always be the first to watch her cook.
Sheron, intrigued and awed by her grandmother’s handwork in creating delicious meals, would sneak a hot taste any moment she could. In addition to being blessed with Florence’s authentic family recipes, Sheron has added a delectable flavorful touch all her own.
Today, 11Hauz is renowned for serving tasty, healthy, and authentic Jamaican dishes in and around the Park City area for years. Sheron, along with her two daughters, Nyesha and Tanisha, and her granddaughter Yanique, invite you to experience a taste of family, a taste of love, and a taste of Jamaica within the gorgeous mountains of Utah.

What Our Friends Say
Our food Speaks for itself, but hear what other say
11 Hauz was one of the highlights of our trip! After a mediocre meal in park city I got a random recommendation for an “authentic Jamaican restaurant” on the lift.  Our group of 6 went for dinner and it was incredible. We ordered family style and every dish was incredible. The rum punch (and another rum drink I can’t remember) were both phenomenal.  I can’t recommend 11 Hauz more!
Tyler Norton ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
This is my favorite restaurant in Park City. Jerk chicken wings, curry Roti with chicken, jerk shrimp…AMAZING! Also, the service is truly incredible. They are so kind and attentive. I will absolutely be coming back.
Lara Tang ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
My family and I visited this week and I must say this was a pleasant surprise. When I saw they were located right outside our resort, we had to try it. The family that works here is phenomenal. The service was great and the food was even better. I’m still shocked at how tasty the beef patties were considering location and altitude! A must try!
C.S. Harden ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Amazing authentic Jamaican food in skier’s paradise.  Come visit this family owned restaurant. Highly recommend the goat and chicken curry. And get a beef patty pie too!
Hung Lee ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Phenomenal food and friendly, fantastic service from Sonny. The beef patty was to die for and everything else (oxtail, roti curry, jerk chicken and shrimp) was so flavorful too! We'll definitely be back soon.
Amy Rogers ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
If I could give it 10 stars I would, hands down some of the best food in Utah by a mile. The jerk chicken and the curry tofu were top notch. Highly recommend this place.
Joe W ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Best chicken curry I ever ate in my life!! And I swear Im not exaggerating! Food tastes so delicious and fresh!

Don’t Just Take It From Us!
We tried this place because of its large gluten free options. It has become our go to wing spot because we liked it so much.
The wings are crispy and juicy and the sauces are on point! Even better, they’re actually healthy because everything is baked, which I never would have guessed because they’re so good.
The Buffalo chicken wrap is also really good and the Buffalo chips with ranch are awesome!!
We have yet to try anything we don’t like.
Highly recommend Wing Nutz.
-Elena R.
This is my second time here and Wing Nutz nailed it again for great tasting ""bake wings"".
The wings are so crispy you can't tell they're baked, but they do taste better then fried wings, not to mention better for your health too.  Also,  there is a varies of unique and delicious sauces to choose from too;  I choose the mango Chipotle mild sauce...soooo good!!
-Divina Hardin
Meat fell off the bone because of tenderness. Sauces are amazing. Service was excellent. 10/10 recommend. Worth the higher price for a top quality product.
-David Evans
My husband and I visit at least once a week.  The staff makes us feel like family which is great since we are transplants from the Midwest.  We love that they don’t fry anything including the chips.  The food is consistently delicious.  The chicken tenders have never once been dry!  Very casual, laid back atmosphere.  What’s not to like?

Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
