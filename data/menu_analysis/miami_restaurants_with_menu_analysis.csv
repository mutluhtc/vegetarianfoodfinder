THE CULTURE OF PIZZA VERACE
We were the first to bring true Neapolitan pizza to Florence. The one with the high crust, the dough leavened for 48 hours and baked only in a wood-fired oven. It was 2005 and for Florentines it was a novelty. Today ‘O Munaciello is a solid reality and loved by the whole city, as well as by tourists.

Scroll to next section
A restaurant created by Major Food Group, CARBONE VINO brings the CARBONE brand’s famed Italian cuisine and iconic atmosphere to the heart of Coconut Grove, along with an array of exciting features unique to this location.
We’ve tried to create something truly special for Coconut Grove: a restaurant that delivers the quintessential CARBONE experience while sharing wonderful new recipes that draw on years of refinement and our ongoing love affair with Italian cuisine. I hope to become a regular at CARBONE VINO, and I have a feeling that many others will, too.
—Chef & MFG Co-Founder, Mario Carbone
ABOUT
Located in the heart of Coconut Grove, CARBONE VINO presents all of the legendary restaurant brand’s signature dishes, a collection of exceptional new additions to the repertoire, and a dynamic beverage program that gives guests the opportunity to enjoy fine and rare wines by the glass. Adding to the concept’s appeal is a world-class bar that serves the complete menu and welcomes walk-ins—because CARBONE VINO was designed to be the kind of restaurant that diners can visit time and time again.
MACARONI
The menu boasts several new macaroni selections by Chef Mario Carbone, like Pumpkin Agnolotti, Tortellini with Truffles, and Spaghettini Bambini, an elevated ode to the buttered noodles Italian children grow up eating, prepared here with grass-fed butter and a coveted aged Parmigiano Reggiano. All of our macaroni is crafted in-house daily.

Mediterranean & Asian Fusion Rooftop Restaurant in Miami
Welcome to a place where celebrating and dining seamlessly merge into one unique experience.
The distinctively curated rooftop space pays homage to the simple spirit of Cycladic design, fused with Wabi-Sabi inspired details. MILA's cuisine is inspired by Asian and Mediterranean eating practices, both healthful and tasteful, embracing the importance of enjoying life.
The kitchen, under the helm of 26-times Michelin awarded Chef Michaël Michaelidis, and Corporate Chef Joshua Walls, aims to take guests on a culinary journey through the shores of the Mediterranean and Japan while creating a creative expression of flavorful MediterrAsian cuisine.
Dishes are served in the informal izakaya dining style, meaning they are meant to be shared at the table, in an energetic setting, paired with theatrical tableside preparations.

""Life is a combination of magic and pasta""
- Federico Fellini
At Macchialina, that magic extends beyond the pasta bowl. It lives in the handmade tagliatelle, the deep reds and crisp whites, the way a good glass of wine brings everything together. Our kitchen, led by Chef Michael Pirolo, honors the traditions of rustic Italian cooking with a modern, seasonal twist, crafting award-winning pastas from the highest quality ingredients and pairing them with a thoughtful selection of wines that speak the same language.
Explore both sides of the experience.

About Us
Pummarola is an authentic Neapolitan pizzeria. We serve pizza, pasta, sandwiches, salads, sides, and dessert, based on the original recipes of our dear Nonna Rosa. Our pizza is baked to perfection in our wood-fired ovens, built and imported from Naples, Italy, to achieve the authentic, fire-kissed flavor of home. Our fresh ingredients are also imported from Italy, from the savory plum tomatoes in our marinara sauce, to the Polselli flour in our dough. At Pummarola, we strive to create delicious meals and memorable experiences. Order online today for delivery, takeout, or curbside pickup!

What Is a Group Order?
Now you can place orders easily with your friends, family, and coworkers.
With group ordering, you can create one order as the host, and then share a link to that order with a group of people. Your guests can then add their choices to the order. Everyone will be able to see the order in real-time. As the host, you can also set a spend limit for your guests.
Once everyone has ordered, it is the host's responsbility to complete the order and make the final payment. The order will then be sent through all at once.

Novecento is a luxurious restaurant, located in the heart of one of the trendiest gastronomic areas of Key Biscayne, Miami. The restaurant group has more than 25 years of experience and landmark locations in Miami, México DF, Buenos Aires and Córdoba (Argentina) and Punta del Este (Uruguay).
Chosen by thousands of celebrities and tourists from all over the world, Novecento is a must on the trip of any sybarite who enjoys a unique culinary experience: distinguished dishes with an Argentine print, seasonal and excellent quality products, and a team that gives life to this meeting place.
Here you will find a fascinating combination of glamour and the warm welcome of the caribbean sun, with the joy and generosity that in Argentina people receive their guests at home. In a few words, the perfect combination to enjoy a very Novecento moment.

We offer an excellent Novecento-style experience, with a 3-course menu of your choice, an exclusive wine proposal and table service.

If you were thinking about organizing something at home or in a hall, you can’t miss our CATERING proposals: our premium barbecue, with our Argentinean imprint, is all you need to become the best host. High quality meat and cuts, ready to be served at your table.

There's nothing more decadent than fresh Florida seafood, and when visitors and locals in Hollywood and Miami, Florida, want the best, they head to Billy's Stone Crab. As one of the
top waterfront restaurants in Hollywood, FL
, Billy's Stone Crab has been serving up the best stone crab, lobster, and other seafood items for years. From succulent stone crab to types of seafood pasta, we have something to suit every taste. Pull up a chair and dive into our dinner menu to discover a few of our fan-favorite entrees.
Dinner Time Delights
The first thing you'll notice when you step inside Billy's Stone Crab is the elegant decor in the spacious dining room. Our seafood restaurant features floor-to-ceiling windows and stunning views of the waterfront. While the decor and ambiance are of an upscale restaurant, our food is sourced locally from Florida fishermen who harvest their catch fresh every day.
Our dinner menu features everything from specialty entrees like honey ginger salmon to fabulous steaks and pasta dishes. Our seafood is the star of the show, with crab harvested at the peak of stone crab season and wild shrimp caught in the Florida Keys. We have shareable sides such as grilled tomatoes, lobster mac, sweet potato fries, and garlic creamed spinach.
Stone Crab: A Must-Try Delight
Stone crab is the cream of the crop of Florida shellfish and one of the most in-demand types of seafood. What does stone crab taste like? Stone crab has a very mild flavor and a delicate texture that requires it to be eaten very quickly after it's harvested. It is slightly sweet and devoid of any strong ""fishy"" flavor. Stone crab is a must-try, especially if you're new to Florida or visiting the area for the first time.
At Billy's Stone Crab, we sustainably harvest stone crab from trained fishermen and serve it to our guests with the utmost care and precision. Dip the meat into our accompanying mustard sauce and discover why this delicacy is one of our top picks.
Pasta Perfection
Nothing soothes the soul and nourishes your spirit after a long day on the water like pasta. We have specialties like chicken piccata and chicken alfredo and seafood pasta such as shrimp scampi. At Billy's Stone Crab restaurant, you can customize your perfect seafood pasta dish. Select either alfredo or marinara sauce on your fettuccini noodles and then tuck into a dish full of the finest seafood, including scallops, lobster, mahi, and jumbo shrimp.
Steak Lovers
We proudly feature premium steaks and chops at Billy's Stone Crab. Our NY strip steak is 18 ounces, while our filet mignon is 12 ounces of extra-tender, flavorful beef. For the heartiest appetites, we have a 24-ounce bone-in ribeye cooked to your exacting specifications. You can also opt for a rack of lamb, grilled to perfection and served with romesco and chimichurri to bring out the natural flavors of the meat.
Sides and Add-Ons: Make it a Feast
No dinner is complete without sides, and at Billy's Stone Crab, we have side options and add-ons to suit everyone's palate. Our sides are all big enough to share, with options such as brussels sprouts, hashbrowns, grilled tomatoes, sweet potato fries, cole slaw, asparagus hollandaise, and lobster mac and cheese. Order up three or four different sides and try a little bit of everything! We don't play favorites, but we do have a soft spot for our grilled tomatoes, the ideal accompaniment for meat, chicken, or seafood.
Your Perfect Dinner Awaits
Whether you're in Florida for a few days or a lifetime, Billy's Stone Crab is the perfect choice for a fantastic dining experience you won't soon forget. Discover our dinner menu today and contact us to learn more about our delicious meal options.

CHEF LOUIE BOSSI
Louie Bossi is not your typical chef. Growing up in an Italian household in New York he remembers the aromas of roasted garlic and fresh meatballs sizzling from
his family’s kitchen.
Raised by a single mother juggling three jobs, Bossi taught himself to cook at the age of eight. Working his way from dishwasher to cook at the local pizzeria Bossi developed a love for the art of pizza making.
Relocating to Florida in 2000, Bossi landed his first job with Big Time Restaurant Group as grill cook. Exploring different positions within their popular portfolio of restaurants Chef Bossi proved to be one of the hardest working and most inspired chefs in the company, which earned him the coveted Executive Chef position at Big City Tavern. Bossi's D.I.Y. approach has led him to obtain a certification from Chef Brian Polcyn in the ancient art and technique of charcuterie, as well as becoming a Master Pizza Maker from The Scuola Italiana Pizzaoili in San Francisco.
Lisabet Summa joined Big Time Restaurant Group in 1997 as the restaurant group executive chef and partner. Since then she has opened over a dozen restaurants.
Growing up in Lake Forest, Illinois her inspiration for pursuing a career in the culinary arts began. Summa largely views herself as a cook, an armchair traveler,
and an artisan.
She began working at a 5 star mobile-rated restaurant called St. Honore and also studied pastry and chocolate making in Montreal at the renowned Patisserie De Gascoigne. Later Summa become the Chef at Café L’Europe, one of the most highly acclaimed restaurants in Palm Beach, and Pastry Chef at La Vielle Maison in Boca.
The cooking knowledge that Summa employs on a daily basis comes from her experience in various positions in the kitchen. Summa spends a lot of time simplifying what she intends for a menu, and getting back to the elements that truly make a dish a success. Summa’s motto is flavor, seasoning, product quality and technique.

Our Bird Road restaurant was our first restaurant in Miami. We established our market on Bird Road and then, when the cafeteria behind the market closed, we took that as a sign to take over the space and open a restaurant. The Bird Road restaurant includes a fire pit and is a great place for a family meal. Open for lunch and dinner.

T&T is an institution, and all they've done is move forward. There food has remained steady in quality and they've been trying out new week day deals. Also the car shows are awesome.

Â¿Quien soy YO?
Â¡Soy DoÃ±a Leonor, su madre, chingao! AprendÃ­ a cocinar con el chilito en mano y la rienda suelta. Llevo en la sangre el sazÃ³n de mi tierra, y cada taco que sirvo va cargado de historia, risas y un poquito de descaro. AquÃ­, siÃ©ntete con confianza de soltar la carcajada y darte el gustazo: al final, en esta fonda, el Ãºnico requisito es venir con hambre y muchas ganas de pasarla bien.

En Fonda DoÃ±a Leonor, cada platillo es una celebraciÃ³n de los sabores autÃ©nticos de MÃ©xico. Preparados con ingredientes frescos y siguiendo las recetas tradicionales, nuestros platillos te llevarÃ¡n directo a las raÃ­ces de la cocina mexicana. Desde las clÃ¡sicas quesadillas hasta los suculentos tacos y sopas, cada bocado estÃ¡ hecho con el corazÃ³n.

The critically acclaimed Mexican fine-dining concept from Major Food Group
Situated inside a magnificent 20th-century chateau in the heart of Brickell, Miami, Chateau ZZ’s marks the reimagining of one of the most magnificent European-style manors in the United States, by the renowned Ken Fulk, which now features interiors that encourage sophisticated indulgence.
From theatrical tableside guacamole, vibrant raw-bar items like the signature Michelada oysters, celebratory entrées from the grill, and over 1,000 tequilas and mezcals, our chefs proudly prepare an array of tortillas, sauces, and other foundational Mexican recipes on premises every single day.

A LEGENDARY ADDRESS
Formerly known as Petit Douy, this architectural marvel was built in 1931 by renowned architect Martin L. Hampton and designated a historically protected building in 1983. The manor was the residence of John and Sheelah Murrel, noteworthy figures in the development of modern Miami, for more than fifty years. Now open to the public for the very first time, the reimagined estate is a collaboration between Major Food Group and Ken Fulk, Inc.
THE EXPERIENCE
A night at the Chateau is brought to life by MFG’s tuxedo-clad service captains across a variety of gorgeous environments that evoke the glamor and nostalgia of Hollywood’s golden era. Whenever you choose to visit, we hope to make your time with us as an occasion.
MAJOR FOOD GROUP
Founded a decade ago by Jeff Zalaznick, Chef Mario Carbone, and Chef Rich Torrisi, Major Food Group has consistently delivered the most celebrated, innovative, and exciting culinary experiences in the world. Together, the three visionary leaders deliver exceptional, delicious food and hospitality concepts that delight guests, define categories and, while creating distinguishable sense of place in every city, establish new standards for the industry.

About the Business
Established in 2018. At El Camino, our guiding principle is to exceed our guest's expectations in all areas - food, beverage, and ambiance - and create an experience that will arouse and excite our guest's senses.  As a team, we are inspired by the culture and the heritage of Mexico.  To that end, we are passionate about bringing you an authentic experience not typically seen north of the border in chain restaurants.

We are committed to offering the freshest organic and local ingredients where possible, and we value local, artisan, indigenous and reclaimed offerings.  We are even taking the not so typical step of making our own tortillas, sauces, and anything else possible from scratch. The list of craft cocktails is truly Mexican and includes house made sangritas, a curated selection of agave spirits, a diverse selection of craft and Mexican beers.  In the end, it is all about sharing the food with the community of people who enjoy it.  Viva México!

Q:
Are the beans cooked with meat?
A:
I do not think so. It tasted very commercial to me when I was there this past february. I come from a place where there are lots of Mexican restaurants and lots of taco trucks. This place does not compare.

Ashley L.
Business Owner
At Elote Lovers, we're all about bringing people together through bold flavors and comfort food with a twist! We started as a family-owned food truck business (Miami Roasted Corn) in 2011 and grew with years of dedication, hard work, and lots of corn! Our passion for authentic street food and creative flavors has been the heart of everything we do, which led to the expansion of Elote Lovers in 2019.

What started as a small family venture has grown into a place where tradition meets innovation. From our classic Mexican-style elotes to our loaded Crunchwraps, unique street eats, and Fresh Squeezed Lemonade, every bite is crafted with love, quality ingredients, and a little bit of heat!

Whether you're craving something spicy, cheesy, or sweet, there's something for everyone at Elote Lovers. We're proud to serve our community with fresh, flavor-packed food and a welcoming atmosphere that feels like home.

Come taste the difference, and join our family of flavor fanatics!

With foundations in the trendy Miami neighborhood of Sunset Harbour, Barceloneta is Miami’s popular go-to hub for Spanish Mediterranean tapas, seafood, arroz and original gin cocktails.

Tapas originated in the Catalonian region of Spain and are small plates typically consumed with wine or vermouth.
We combine traditional preparations with local ingredients for dishes that are authentic to both their Spanish origins and Miami setting.
Learn more about our story.
For those wanting a true Spanish Mediterranean escapade, Barceloneta is just around the corner.
Make a Reservation
Flowing onto the walkway, “La Terraza” is the go-to place for stylish Sunset Harbour locals. You’ll feel a real sense of community from the buzz of the neighboring restaurants. The full dining menu is available on the terrace, along with all of the Spanish cocktails, wines & beers.
Dine with us and share with friends & family the delicious tastes of Barceloneta.
The Terrace.
Afternoon or evening, the outdoor Lounge is a hotspot for people watching and lounging with a glass of Spanish wine or Gin cocktail, of course. The bar bites menu is available, as well as the full selection of drinks.
Come join us at our local’s favorite, alfresco Lounge.
The Lounge.
Barceloneta, famed for their Spanish Mediterranean influenced tapas and home to the city’s renowned G+T’s.
A diverse city, Miami Beach radiates a multicultural vibe. The Owners love this cosmopolitan attitude and have this flowing throughout the Barceloneta dining room. The venue is usually still buzzing with guests even at 1 AM, the kitchen takes last orders at midnight and the bar will only close once the last guest leaves. The full Lunch & Dinner menu are available in the dining room, with a collection of intimate and social tables to take a seat at.
Dining Room.
Created by Co-Owner Daniella Rezai, Barceloneta’s “La Barra” is renowned for its Gin & Tonics. Reputed in Miami, they encompass character and flair with their citrusy, floral tastes. Served in a traditional over-sized brandy glass, the cocktails offer a revitalized version of the classic cocktail. The bar’s wine collection is exclusively Spanish, as well as many of the liquors. The Bar Bites menu and also the Happy Hour menu are available here.
The perfect place to unwind, socialize and taste the wonderful flavors of the Mediterranean, in the cozy Sunset Harbour neighborhood.

JAGUAR HANDCRAFTED SIGNATURE SAUCES
NUEVO
One of our classic sauces since 2005, this amazing aji amarillo sauce made with a yellow chile pepper from Peru gives our ceviches a special boost and a burst of flavor. It is the star of one of our most popular ceviches “Black Market” combined with corvina, shrimp and calamari. Use this sauce on fried calamari, grilled fish or as a dip for sushi & sashimi
ORIENTAL
This incredible sauce with delicious depths of flavor from roasted jalapeños and our secret mix of fresh herbs and spices pairs great with our tuna “Tiradito Lima”. Use it in everything including as a salad dressing and on top of grilled prawns, shrimp or fish. I myself pour it over carnitas tacos for a fresh and vibrant contrast and balance.
MERKEN
Made with smoked red chiles from Mapuche, Chile, this versatile sauce pairs well with many items. We confit the chiles in our special blend of garlic, onion, and homemade secret vinegar to give the smoked chiles a special tang that brings out the best-rounded flavor. At Jaguar we top the Guacamole with it and it brightens up the avocado and opens up the creaminess of the dish. We also use the oil from this sauce to grill our Quesadillas. I use it on top of fried eggs and also grilled zucchinis and grilled onions as well and every once in a while I use it to top of my burger combined with fried onions.
JAGUAR
a.k.a. “House Sauce” has been paired with our Chips since 2005. An addictive combination of tomato, caramel onions and chile de arbol from Mexico gives a new meaning to “can’t eat just one”. This amazing sauce is our go-to on chips and I myself use it on Chilaquiles even though it’s a bit spicy, the balance of the cream and cheese makes it a perfect breakfast.
MUERTE
Our spiciest sauce ever still manages to have unsurpassed flavor. It’s hot without overpowering the flavor of the sauce or the food it’s meant to enhance. Born while having fun with guests when they wanted something hot but we did not want to give them regular ol’ hot sauce, we created a sauce that’s spicy and full of bright & natural flavors. A couple of drops go a long way.
Recommendations by Chef Oscar del Rivero
All of our sauces are made from only fresh, natural, and organic ingredients and contain zero preservatives. They require to be refrigerated and consumed and enjoyed within 2 weeks

Free and no login required, love that
I hate tools that make you sign up before you can even try them. This one just works. I use it to find domains for client projects — it’s quick, gives Moz and Majestic scores, and some other custom data I’ve not seen elsewhere. Would happily pay for it, but glad I don’t have to!

Takes a bit to get used to but super helpful
Not the fanciest UI in the world, but the data is solid. It took me a bit of clicking around to learn how to get what I need, but once I did, it’s saved me hours. If you’re into SEO or domaining, this is a no-brainer.

Good for flipping or just grabbing brand names
Been using ExpiredDomains for about a month and I’ve already picked up a few solid names — one of them’s already flipped. The name value and SEO price estimates are really handy. I wish the design was a bit cleaner but functionally, it’s spot on.

Honestly didn’t expect it to be this good
Saw this recommended on a forum and didn’t expect much, but wow. The amount of data it shows is crazy for a free tool. I use it mostly to look for brandable names and cross-check SEO value. Already registered a couple. Definitely bookmarking this.

Can’t believe this isn’t behind a paywall
Honestly I’ve paid for similar tools that do less. This lets you search through expired domains and filter down by authority, keywords, backlink stuff, even what platform they’re being sold on. And it updates constantly. Feels like a cheat code tbh.

Great for finding niche domains
I run a few small affiliate sites and I’m always looking for expired domains with decent backlink profiles. ExpiredDomains saves me a ton of time. Filters are a bit overwhelming at first but once you figure it out, it’s so much faster than doing it manually. Found 3 great ones last week.

Takes a bit to get used to but super helpful
Not the fanciest UI in the world, but the data is solid. It took me a bit of clicking around to learn how to get what I need, but once I did, it’s saved me hours. If you’re into SEO or domaining, this is a no-brainer.

Free and no login required, love that
I hate tools that make you sign up before you can even try them. This one just works. I use it to find domains for client projects — it’s quick, gives Moz and Majestic scores, and some other custom data I’ve not seen elsewhere. Would happily pay for it, but glad I don’t have to!

Honestly didn’t expect it to be this good
Saw this recommended on a forum and didn’t expect much, but wow. The amount of data it shows is crazy for a free tool. I use it mostly to look for brandable names and cross-check SEO value. Already registered a couple. Definitely bookmarking this.

Great for finding niche domains
I run a few small affiliate sites and I’m always looking for expired domains with decent backlink profiles. ExpiredDomains saves me a ton of time. Filters are a bit overwhelming at first but once you figure it out, it’s so much faster than doing it manually. Found 3 great ones last week.

Can’t believe this isn’t behind a paywall
Honestly I’ve paid for similar tools that do less. This lets you search through expired domains and filter down by authority, keywords, backlink stuff, even what platform they’re being sold on. And it updates constantly. Feels like a cheat code tbh.

Good for flipping or just grabbing brand names
Been using ExpiredDomains for about a month and I’ve already picked up a few solid names — one of them’s already flipped. The name value and SEO price estimates are really handy. I wish the design was a bit cleaner but functionally, it’s spot on.

At its core, the Kyu Menu is all about rich flavors and vibrant presentations. Picture this: each dish is like a work of art, crafted with precision and an eye for detail. Whether it’s those visually stunning appetizers or hearty main courses that seem to dance on your plate, every bite tells a story. It’s like walking through an art gallery, but instead of paintings, you’re savoring delightful creations that celebrate the beauty of food.
What sets this menu apart is its attention to seasonal ingredients. Think farm-to-table freshness with a twist! Imagine biting into a dish where every ingredient is in harmony, singing the song of the season with every mouthful. It’s not just eating; it’s experiencing the essence of nature’s bounty. Plus, let’s face it: who doesn’t love a dish that’s not only delicious but also Instagram-worthy?
But wait, there’s more! The Kyu Menu doesn’t shy away from innovation, marrying flavors from different cultures. One minute you’re enjoying the warmth of a hearty stew, and the next, you’re tantalized by a zingy, spicy element that surprises you. It’s like taking your palate on a globe-trotting adventure without ever leaving your seat.
And the dessert choices? Oh, get ready for a sweet finale that’ll make you swoon. From rich chocolate creations to delicate pastries, each sweet bite is a delightful goodbye to your culinary journey. So, if you’re up for a meal that’s as much about storytelling as it is about dining, the Kyu Menu is calling your name!
Exploring the Cultural Fusion: The Rise of Kyu Menu in Modern Cuisine
What’s the secret sauce behind this rise? Well, Kyu Menu pulls inspiration from street food stalls in Bangkok, spice markets in Marrakech, and chic bistros in Paris. It’s like a delicious world tour that you can experience without ever leaving your favorite restaurant. Chefs today are daring to play with ingredients that were once limited to a certain region. Picture a spicy kimchi taco or a fragrant Moroccan curry paired with Italian risotto. These mash-ups not only tantalize your taste buds but also tell stories of cultural intersections.
Have you ever wondered how flavors from seemingly opposite cultures can create something spectacular? It’s all about balance and experimentation. Just as a good song mixes different melodies, Kyu Menu finds the perfect rhythm of sweet, salty, sour, and umami. Diners find themselves not just eating, but embarking on a culinary adventure that bridges gaps and fosters unity.
Kyu Menu: A Culinary Journey Through Japan’s Kirin-Style Dining
Think of the Kyu Menu as a charming narrative, where each dish plays its part in a delicious saga. It’s a curated selection that highlights the best of Japan’s culinary traditions, drawing inspiration from Kirin, a symbol of harmony and prosperity. Picture slurping up bowls of rich ramen, the noodles weaving through your taste buds like a well-written poem. Then there’s the tempura, perfectly crispy and light, akin to a gentle breeze on a warm day.
Curiosity piqued yet? The magic of the Kyu Menu lies not just in its flavors but in the craftsmanship behind each dish. It’s like watching an artist at work; every ingredient is handpicked, every technique honed to perfection. As you dive into this dining experience, you’re transported to an intimate corner of Japan, where every bite tells a story of dedication and passion.
Have you ever wondered what it feels like to savor a meal that embodies culture and tradition? At Kyu Menu, that’s exactly what you get. The presentation is an art form all its own—sushi beautifully arranged, inspired by nature’s landscapes, waiting to dance on your palate. And let’s not forget about the sake; it’s like the cherry blossom to your feast, adding that perfect finishing touch to your culinary adventure.
So, if you’re ready to embark on an unforgettable flavor journey, the Kyu Menu is calling your name—will you answer?
Unveiling Kyu Menu: The Secret Behind Scrumptious Japanese Course Meals
Now, what makes Kyu Menu so special? This traditional multi-course dining style, known as Kaiseki, takes you on a culinary journey. Each course is crafted with seasonal ingredients, reflecting nature’s bounty. Think of it like a beautiful symphony, where every note plays perfectly with the next. From the first course’s vibrant sashimi to the last course’s comforting matcha dessert, each plate is designed to tantalize your taste buds and evoke emotions.
But here’s the kicker—Kyu Menu is all about balance. It’s not just a feast for your mouth; it’s a feast for the eyes, too. Imagine the vibrant colors of pickled vegetables next to the rich gloss of soy-glazed fish. Every dish is artfully arranged, almost too pretty to eat—almost, but not quite! The interplay of flavors, textures, and colors is like an impressive dance of taste on your palate.
So, why should you try Kyu Menu? Because it’s a chance to savor Japan’s culinary heritage while indulging in a meal that feels special. Whether you’re celebrating a significant occasion or just treating yourself, experiencing Kyu Menu is like taking a mini-vacation for your senses. Why settle for the ordinary when you can explore the extraordinary? So go ahead, embark on this delicious adventure that lets you indulge in the heart of Japan, one course at a time.
The Art of Balance: How Kyu Menu Elevates Traditional Japanese Fare
Picture this: a carefully curated meal that flows like a beautifully composed piece of music. Each dish plays its part, bringing flavors, textures, and colors together in perfect unison. The magic lies in how Kyu Menu elevates classic ingredients, transforming them into something extraordinary. Think of it as an artist using a limited palette to create a stunning masterpiece. You’ll find staples like rice, fish, and seasonal vegetables, but each is presented with an innovative twist that keeps your taste buds tingling.
Ever heard the saying, “Less is more?” Kyu Menu embodies this philosophy. With an emphasis on simplicity, the focus shifts to the quality of each ingredient. It’s like stepping into an art gallery filled with minimalist sculptures—every piece tells a story, and every detail counts. You can taste the freshness of the ocean in the sashimi, feel the comforting warmth of the perfectly cooked rice, and enjoy the delicate crunch of seasonal pickles.
Savoring Simplicity: The Philosophy Behind Kyu Menu in Gourmet Restaurants
At its core, the Kyu Menu embodies the beauty of simplicity. Just like a perfectly ripened peach on a summer day, it’s all about showcasing the natural flavors without overwhelming your palate with complexity. The idea is to elevate everyday ingredients to extraordinary heights. Think about it: when you savor a dish that’s uncomplicated yet breathtaking, it’s like witnessing a master painter create a vibrant landscape with just a few strokes. This menu strips away the excess and lets every individual flavor sing.
But why does this minimalist approach resonate so deeply? It’s about authenticity. In a world where we often feel bombarded by choices, the Kyu Menu presents a refreshing escape. Each dish invites you to focus on the essence of the ingredients, giving a heartfelt nod to their origins. It’s like the difference between a flamboyant fireworks display and a simple candlelit dinner—a little bit of elegance can go a long way.

HISTORY
The Qianlong Emperor (乾隆帝), born on the 25th of September of 1711, was the fifth emperor of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty, and the fourth Qing emperor to rule over China. The fourth son of the Yongzheng Emperor, he reigned officially from 1736 to 1795.
Despite his retirement, however, he retained ultimate power until his death in 1799, making Qianlong the
longest reigning Emperor in Chinese history. Although his early years saw the continuity of an era of prosperity in
China, he held an unrelentingly conservative attitude.
Many recognize Qianlong as one of the best emperors China has ever had.

PEKING DUCK
History
Peking Duck has earned its place in the list of the most famous and delicious dishes worldwide. Its history originates in the early 1200s in Beijing. At the time, this incredible dish was only available to the imperial family and some members of the upper class, as only the imperial chefs knew how to prepare it.
As story tells it, with the fall of the imperial system in China, the recipes of the Peking Duck were smuggled out of the Forbidden City, and became available to the masses.
Today, Peking Duck remains one of China’s best-known dishes, and a must-try for tourists trekking all the way to Beijing. Luckily, you don’t have to fly 8,000 miles to try this delicacy, as we have brought the Peking Duck to Doral.
To reserve your Peking Duck, call us at (305)-477-8188.

ABOUT US
Qianlong follows a tradition born in China, when our Moy family started working in the food industry before emigrating in 1957. Since then, we have owned and operated a number of restaurants in the United States and Venezuela. Deeply rooted in the flavorful Chinese culinary heritage and committed to absolute customer satisfactions, all dining enterprises have been embraced by generations in search of quality ingredients freshly cooked to order.
OUR HISTORY
Our family has a long culinary heritage, which started in the Canton Province. After working in the food industry in China, my grandfather Moy Chin Yen and our family emigrated to Venezuela in 1957. Shortly after, we opened the first of many restaurants, called Los Farolitos (The Beacons), in Maracaibo. Only two years later, our family opened El Palmar (The Palm Grove), in the capital city of Caracas. Although originally a steakhouse, the service quickly switched to Chinese food, and soon turned into a sample in the Venezuelan capital.
Over the years, El Palmar became more than a restaurant and our family became major players in the Chinese cooking in Venezuela. The location became known as “the restaurant of the presidents” due to the liking the country heads of state took to it. The place where presidents dined also offered a relaxing and warm atmosphere becoming a landmark place for families to gather and enjoy freshly cooked Cantonese meals.
Moy Chin Yen aided by his sons, expanded into United States, opening House of Moy in New York as well as another venture in Houston. We utilized our business acumen for innovation and culinary traditions, becoming pioneers in their own right. We were responsible for having brought Peking duck to Venezuela from New York, a dish previously unavailable in the Latin-American country. Cook to perfection, close to 100 Pecking ducks would be sold out in a daily basis.
I am the youngest restaurateur, Yony Moy, followed the steps of my grandfather Chin Yen and father Federico, opening five more restaurants and keeping a culinary and family enterprise alive for what today spans over six decades. This tradition still lies in the hands of myself, who came to Miami in 2008 and opened Qianlong in Doral. Qianlong was built upon the promises of customer service, a warm ambience and freshly cooked food in the same way as the previous venture were, and was welcomed with open arms by not only the Venezuelan community but by everyone who seeks to indulge in the flavors of Cantonese food.

I absolutely LOVED Pao. The service was fantastic & ambience was very lively. The food was delicious & I left wanting to try the Foie Gras since I was so full. I will be returning!

Memorable service and beautiful ambience. Food was presented exquisitely. The Wagyu Carpaccio was by far my favorite dish.

My recent stay at the Faena Hotel Miami was nothing short of exceptional. Everything from our room accommodations, to the service, and to meals was outstanding. I highly recommend dining at the Faena's Pao restaurant.

Q:
Do they close early? I tried to order and call at 9 pm and no one answered?
A:
They close at 10pm Tuesday to Thursday and from Friday to Sunday at 10:30pm, closed on Mondays. It's difficult to get a hold of someone, they're constantly getting takeout orders.

* Consuming raw or undercooked meats, eggs or fish may increase your risk of foodborne illness especially if you have certain medical conditions there is a risk associated
with consuming raw oysters. If you have chronic illness of the liver, stomach or blood, or have immune disorders, you are at greater risk of serious illness from raw oysters,
and should eat oysters fully cooked. If unsure of your risk, consult a physician.

About the Business
This gem is an absolute winner! Thai is a dime a dozen in Miami and theirs is truly superb. ATK pays special attention to the integrity of their ingredients and it definitely shows. These little geniuses have single handedly put many places to shame! The food is delicious and the presentation is just lovely! There is never such a thing as over ordering- if your leftovers make it past 3am fridge raids, your willpower deserves respect.

Chef’s Specials
Sichuan Boiled Beef
A classic dish from Sichuan cuisine, featuring tender slices of beef poached in a rich, spicy broth infused with chili oil, Sichuan peppercorns, garlic, and doubanjiang (fermented chili bean paste). Served over a bed of vegetables, it’s known for its bold flavors, numbing spiciness, and fragrant aroma—a perfect balance of heat and umami.
Sichuan Poached Fish
A signature Sichuan dish featuring tender fish fillets gently poached in a tangy, spicy broth made with pickled mustard greens, chili oil, garlic, and Sichuan peppercorns. The soup is both sour and savory, with a refreshing aroma and a subtle numbing heat that perfectly complements the delicate texture of the fish.
Black Pepper Mango Beef Cubes
Tender cubes of beef stir-fried with fresh mango and crushed black pepper, creating a bold and aromatic fusion of savory, sweet, and spicy flavors. The juicy mango balances the heat of the black pepper, while the beef adds richness—an unexpected yet harmonious blend of tropical fruit and robust seasoning.
Sweet and Sour Osmanthus Pork
A refined twist on the classic sweet and sour pork. Tender pork strips are lightly battered and fried to a golden crisp, then glazed in a tangy-sweet sauce accented with osmanthus syrup. The dish combines fruity aroma, crispy texture, and a delicate floral note, offering a harmonious balance of flavor and elegance.
Chongqing Spicy Chicken
A fiery and flavorful dish from Chongqing, featuring crispy fried chicken pieces tossed with a mountain of dried chili peppers, Sichuan peppercorns, garlic, and aromatic spices. Known for its bold heat and numbing sensation, this dish delivers a crispy texture and an addictive, punchy flavor that’s a hallmark of Sichuan cuisine.
Crab Roe Xiao Long Bao Dumplings
A luxurious take on the classic soup dumpling, filled with a rich mixture of minced pork, crab meat, and crab roe, along with a savory broth. Wrapped in a delicate, thin skin and steamed to perfection, these dumplings offer an indulgent burst of ocean flavor with every bite—elegant, juicy, and deeply satisfying.
Signature Dishes
Peking Duck
Rose Suger Peking Duck, Our signature duck is infused with subtle floral notes, dry-aged and slow-roasted until glassy crisp. Served with delicate rose-scented suger, fluffy pancakes, zingy hoisin sauce, crunchy cucumbers, and spring scallion. Bold, rich, and Insta-worthy — classic taste meets modern vibes.

MAKE YOUR MEAL
BY FOLLOWING
THESE 5 TIPS
ENJOYABLE
Use metal tongs provided to move raw meat on the grill.
1
Use your chopsticks to remove cooked meat
from the grill.
Do not load the grill up with too many meats
2
at the same time. This increases the risk of fire.
Meats that are higher in fat content
3
(especially Toro Beef and Pork) should be cooked
around the edges of the grill.
Table sauces go in your sauce tray and not on the grill.
While meat is cooking on the grill, do not add any table
4
sauces on it. For best flavor, add the sauces when your
meats are cooked and on your plate!

SUMMER SPICE
COCKTAIL & HAPPY HOUR
BRUNCH SPECIALS
DINNER MENU
Phuc Yea is throwing its own spice party this summer.
This isn’t a prix-fixe—it’s a damn mood. Bold flavors dripping in heat, dishes that flirt with your senses, and a table that feels more like a vibe than a meal.
No labels. No rules. Everyone else can chase Spice, but we’re here to stir it.

Bonus: Add a ‘Tini With a Snack for Just $15
What sets this experience apart? For a limited time, guests can kick things off with a signature martini and a paired snack—curated by Phuc Yea’s award-winning bar team—for just $15 (normally $24). It’s not just a drink. It’s a vibe. Created by four different bartenders, each ‘tini brings a distinct personality—whether it’s the Gibson-inspired Madame Ho Chi Minh with crispy pickled onion wontons or the spicy tequila-forward Golden Child with goat cheese–stuffed olives. It’s culinary storytelling in a coupe glass.

ABOUT US
KUFFO Restaurant is Inspired by my grandmother  and her love for quality and cultural food. After relocating to the United States when I was 17 years old I saw opportunities to further develop my own creativity in the culinary industry. I then proceeded to venture in to my own business where I had the opportunity to refine my culinary techniques. I have decided to open KUFFO in the summer of 2020. A restaurant fully dedicated gourmet Asian Fusion Cuisine located in Country Walk. The branding of the restaurant is her. KUFFO has a menu of infused flavors inspired by global travels. While cooking is my passion my real joy comes from making my guests happy. Whether it is putting on an event, providing catering, or serving food in my restaurant it’s all about the experience.

Wine BY THE GLASS
Our Food
The aim with every dish we serve at LPM is to create a mouthful of food that will not be forgotten – and which you cannot find or reproduce elsewhere. Behind that is a journey to explore the essential joy at the heart of the ingredients of the Riviera that we take as our inspiration. Starting, of course, on the Côte d'Azur and the Ligurian coastline, but extending around all the shores of the Mediterranean. The sun-soaked artichokes, lemons, olives, courgettes, tomatoes, peppers and girolles, the freshest seafood, meat and pasta: they lead everything.

Gourmet pizza served 24 hours a day 7 days a week, there really couldn't be anything better than this. Venezia Pizza & Lounge is the place to go for delicious food whenever you want. While we specialize in pizza, our extensive menu also offers delicious breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu that is sure to satisfy any appetite at any time. No matter what time it is, feel free to dine in, pick up, or let us bring it you. We also would love to make your next event or party extra special with our catering services. 

Venezia Pizza & Lounge provides friendly service along with an amazing atmosphere that continuously keeps our customers coming back again and again. We also think that since we're open 24 hours doesn't hurt either. You haven't tasted real pizza until you've experienced gourmet pizza from Venezia Pizza & Lounge.

Located in the heart of Florida’s Riviera, Sunny Isles Beach, Timo has become an icon of neighborhood restaurants since
opening in 2003.
With Chef Tim Andriola’s Italian-Mediterranean inspired cuisine and a timeless attentive dining room, Timo has earned a following of South Florida and national pundits equally. The restaurant’s warm inviting atmosphere is the perfect place for a quick bite, an intimate meal, or a fun meeting place to gather with family and friends. Timo offers an exquisite menu with only the highest quality and freshest ingredients available.
The menu changes seasonally and offers a contemporary Italian-Mediterranean
interpretation of traditional favorites complemented by an exceptional wine list of old world and new world selections alike. What started out as two F.I.U. Hospitality major students dream has turned into a four-star neighborhood restaurant.
We hope you enjoy!

Business Owner
You've heard about it. You've read about it. Now it's time to try the world's greatest chili dog for yourself. Arbetter's Hot Dogs started in 1959 as a way to add some good cheer and great flavors to our neighbors' days, and we've been cooking up our family recipes ever since.

The Boiling Crab Home
For some reason, people think fishermen like to tell stories. Well, our fishermen don’t. While all the other crabbers and captains were packed into the local bar boozing and swapping sea tales, ours were back home, playing with spices and boiling the best of their fresh catch for the family. Ok, they were probably drinking too. We haven’t been telling our story since 2004, but we do write it down almost every day. It’s written in Sha-bang sauce all over your bib and with beer spilt across the table. Every face in here has our story written on it in smiles and smears. Because the best stories aren’t just told, they’re tasted and lived.

El Mago de las Fritas
BY
Martha and Ortelio Cardenas
Ortelio and Eva Cardenas have been making the classic «Cuban Frita» since the 1950’s in Cuba where Ortelio Cardenas was coined as ""El Mago"" when making fritas.
With the rise of the Cuban Revolution, the Cardenas family moved to Miami, FL bringing their tradition with them, thus, opening El Mago de las Fritas in 1984.
What is a
Cuban Frita?
A Cuban Frita is a unique interpretation of a hamburger with ground beef and chorizo blend patty with cooked & raw onions topped with potato wisps, all sandwiched between Cuban bread.
El Mago de las Fritas has its doors open in Miami to locals and tourists alike for over 35 years. Cardenas is now accompanied by his daughter, Martha Cardenas in operating this beloved hidden gem nestled in 8th street.
While the classic Cuban Frita is their specialty, the family has created various modern & innovative variations of the frita along with unique hot dogs, bowls & more! With their core based in family, the Cardenas’ treat every customer like a member of their own family.
Our Menu
We know there are many options and we are so happy you have allowed us to be part of your day.
As Mago says- ""if you do not like the food tell Mago if you do like it tell the world!""

El Mago De Las Fritas has made its home in Miami on 8th street (Calle Ocho) since 1984, though it’s not the only frita place on Calle Ocho. Four of the five old-school Frita Cubana Joints (
El Mago de las Fritas,
El Rey de las Fritas
,
Fritas Domino
&
La Palma
) are on Calle Ocho.

MICHELIN GUIDE
Since the beginning, we dreamed of the possibility that a Colombian cuisine restaurant could ascend to the gastronomic firmament with its own Michelin Star. Today, that dream has materialized, consolidating the prestige of our Elcielo restaurants, awarded the coveted Michelin Star, a symbol of global excellence.
These accolades are testimonies to our relentless pursuit of perfection, demonstrating that the refinement and innovation of our cuisine can conquer the world’s most discerning palates.

Q:
What vegan or vegetarian options are available?
A:
There are a couple but I usually get the falafel platter with hummus and lentil rice (im vegetarian but all of this might also be vegan), it also comes with pita, tahini, and some pickled vegetables. There are a few more sides that you can choose…

The world’s most famous Mediterranean restaurant… In Miami Beach
In 2021, the hitmakers behind Carbone and ZZ’s Club joined forces with renowned Israeli chef Eyal Shani to bring his signature concept HaSalon to the heart of Miami Beach. Discover a style of Mediterranean cuisine that is impossibly generous and alive, along with a bacchanalian vibe that makes this a restaurant like no other.
Chef Eyal Shani
Shani was born in Jerusalem in 1959. His culinary passion was first instilled in him by his grandfather, an agronomist and a dedicated vegan, who exposed him to local markets, fields, and vineyards from a young age.
In 1989 he opened his first restaurant ""Oceanus"" in his home town of Jerusalem. There, he developed a unique culinary language based on regional Mediterranean products: olive oil, fish, tahini, fresh seasonal vegetables and of course, the tomato.
The Cuisine
From the HaSalon’s signature open kitchen, Shani’s chefs prepare an extravagant parade of bright salads, vibrant vegetable dishes, satisfying pastas, and show-stopping courses meant for sharing, such as whole fish and roasted meats. Menu selections change according to the seasons and the restaurant’s restless creativity, but HaSalon's famous emphasis on generous flavors, full of life, is always on display.

The Experience
HaSalon may have been born in Tel Aviv, but it was made for the Magic City, delivering the nightly supper club atmosphere that has made it a global sensation.

Business Owner
MIAMI, FLA. - (November 2019) - Three years after opening Meraki Greek Bistro on a hidden alley in Downtown Miami, Managing Partner Alex Karavias and Executive Chef Giannis Kotsos have announced the debut of Meraki Coconut Grove located at 3462 Main Highway in Coconut Grove. The second location quietly opened in October, bringing elevated, authentic Greek cuisine and elegant coastal design to area residents and visitors alike. 

""Meraki means to 'put something of yourself into whatever you do', and that's exactly what Chef Giannis and I have been doing since we opened the original Meraki location three years ago,"" said Alex Karavias. ""'I've always dreamed of opening a restaurant here in Coconut Grove, where my first encounters in Miami's culinary scene started years ago, and we are excited to expand the Meraki brand and bring our approachable and authentic Greek cuisine to the community.""

Customer Feedback
what our happy customers say about us
If you want to try real Greek food with a great taste, good prices and very good service, this is the place to go. Their Pastitsio is soooo good that is the top in Miami and compared to the one I had in a greek island, it is the second. And for desserts, they bake a Galactobourico that is simply out of this world, to a point than when I order it I tell my family to get their own ones, because I do not share.
Hector
Went there with a few buddies, this was the best Greek Food I’ve ever had. We had the lambshank, village salad, satziki with gyro meat, and Greek fries. The pita bread nice perfectly warmed with olive oil and lemon flavor. Most pita bread ive ever had is pan fried, not here, it had beautiful grill marks.
Then we had their famous Pagoto (icecream) over shreaded wheat, called birds nest. The best warm and cold icecream experience.
Jet
The service, cleanness, food all are second to none. This is a home made Greek food tastes if YA YA made it fresh!!!
The ingredients are and taste so fresh and good quality. The service is very friendly and prompt. Prices are a bit high, but the location is Coral Gables and quality is superb, so I am willing to pay a bit more for freshness and taste. The grilled octopus appetizer is the best I have had in America. Stuffed cabbage was just amazingly seasoned and prepared.

About the Business
Poseidon Greek Restaurant & Outdoor Lounge has made his new home in South Beach and now hungry diners who crave the fabulous flavors of Greek, Mediterranean and seafood cuisine can check out this new eatery. At Poseidon, the chefs follow Hippocrates recommendation that ""food be thy medicine"", by crafting healthy dishes rather than making popsicles from cough syrup. They sprinkle their recipes with krocus kozanis, a golden Greek spice, and infuses meals with oregano, rosemary, and thyme culled from the Taygetos Mountain of Kalamata. They also import fresh fish from the Aegean Sea before brushing salmon with extra virgin olive oil and tossing pasta with a medley of shellfish. Slick white tables and cool blue walls recall a refreshing day spent among the blue and white abodes lining the Greek shores of the Mediterranean.
Prepare yourselves for a culinary journey to Greece through this wonderful experience and taste. Plus, with one of the best outdoor dining!

Plant-based Organic Deli & Market
Since 2015 and through our sister company, Artichoke Foods, we distribute frozen artisanal and organic vegan meals and products to our clients, developing the wholesale market around South Florida.
With the support of our customers, partners, community friends and family, we are making our dream come true by opening our first store front to the public where we now offer nutritious, organic and fresh plant based food by the pound. All our ingredients are free from pesticides, GMO’s, chemicals, hormones, preservatives, colorants, or additives.
We prepare our food as nature provides it. Maintaining its natural virtues and nutrients, free of refinements and genetic treatments, respecting in this way the intelligence of Mother Nature.
From the soil to the store, all stages are taken care of and controlled by trained personnel, paying attention to every single detail in the process.
Come and visit us at our new location where you will find not only fresh food but delicious and healthy products and snacks featuring local artisans.

Best Vegan Restaurant in Miami
Community choice: 2022, 2023 & 2025
We’re honored to be recognized once again by our amazing community. This year, we were voted
“Best Vegan Restaurant in Miami”
for the third time and, for the first time,
“Best Healthy Restaurant in Miami.”
These awards belong to all of you — your trust, love, and support make everything possible. Our mission remains the same: to create conscious, healthy food with passion and responsibility, honoring our bodies, our health, and Mother Earth.
Thank you for growing with us. Forever grateful.
With love,
María, Luciano & our wonderful team
Plant-based and Organic
They say preparation is one of the most important steps for making a delicious dish, and it’s true, but preparation is nothing without quality ingredients, that’s why we choose to support local organic suppliers, this way we make sure we get fresh, nutritious and flavorous products. If you cook with love and passion plus the possibility of having high-quality products just around the corner, you get the perfect combo for making something spectacular.
Cook consciously and most of all cook with love!

Purchase of the domain was straightforward, and the negotiations were fair. Correspondence times were prompt and fast. I am giving four stars because if I had been able to get the price 10% lower, I feel I would've had a better deal. The delivery of the domain was quick and frictionless. I hope to buy again from HugeDomains in the future as the process was graceful and pleasant.
- Darren, September 1, 2025

It was easy to purchase and link to official Google work account.

Positive and helpful email communication throughout the entire process of purchasing the selected domain, friendly dealings, we negotiated a discount of 200 USD (20% of the original price) from the original requested price for the purchased domain, with delivery of the domain within 24 hours. I highly recommend it. I would use the HugeDomains offer again!
- Ivana Marie Primusová, August 29, 2025
P
Transaction was very straightforward, price was fair for the domain purchased, and I appreciate the option to schedule the payment of the domain over a few months without extra interest or charges. Much recommended!

Visited with some friends and loved the environment. The day was clear and windy making it a great experience. We shared a bottle of the Category 3 Hurricane and it was  really good. We did not have time to try the brewery but I think it's a great excuse to go back. There are multiple wine options including wine tasting. It's a great place to spend an evening with friends or family. Totally recommend and I'm hoping to go back soon.

This is a place that you must visit when you’re in the Homestead area! Place is beautifully decorated and well thought out. They have a a lovely outdoor area where kids can run around and play while adults admire the exotic fish in the pond.
The food and service are top notch! I had never tried any tropical fruit wine before until I came to this place! Mia, our server, is extremely knowledgeable in the menu and offered us some suggestions! I had the burger and the meat was cooked to the temperature I requested and presentation was nice! We also had the tuna salad, which was very refreshing!
Tip: They also serve coffee! We had an expresso, latte and mocha!

If you’re looking for a great experience at Schnebly Redlands Winery, ask for Layla as your waitress. Layla is attentive, friendly, and has excellent knowledge of the menu, both in terms of food and wine. She goes out of her way to ensure that your dining experience is comfortable and enjoyable. Whether you’re a regular or visiting for the first time, she makes sure you’re well taken care of. Layla is quick to recommend the perfect wine pairings and provides prompt service without being overbearing. Her welcoming attitude adds a personal touch to the overall ambiance of Schnebly’s. Highly recommended!
