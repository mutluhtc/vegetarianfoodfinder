SANDWICHES
Whole and half available on most items
Corned Beef Sandwich
$20.45
We start with a brisket of beef, ""corn"" it with our secret spices and rub, and slice it hot when you order your sandwich. About 6 ounces of meat on every sandwich with our famous rye bread, or whatever you choose, creates a huge, two handed meal. No Cryovac, no processed pieces parts, just fresh meat!
85% beef, 15% rye bread, 100% Shapiros!
Pastrami Sandwich
$20.85
No Cryovac, No processed pieces parts! We start with a navel of beef, smoke it with our secret spices and rub, and slice it hot when you order your sandwich. About 6 ounces of meat on every sandwich with our famous rye bread, or whatever you choose, creates a huge, two handed meal.
85% beef, 15% rye bread, 100% Shapiros!
Corn-ami  Sandwich
$21.75
Corned Beef+Pastrami. We create this sandwich with half Shapiro's corned beef and half Shapiro's pastrami! You choose the bread and extra stuff.
Reuben (Sauerkraut)
$21.50
Our delicious, house made corned beef piled high with two slices of German Swiss cheese, a thick splat of Russian dressing, and sauerkraut in the middle of the meat, grilled to a golden brown, served with our pickle for the perfect blending of flavors in one sandwich! Our best seller.
New York Reuben (Cole Slaw)
$21.50
Pictured above. Our delicious, house made corned beef piled high with two slices of German Swiss cheese, a thick splat of Russian dressing, and Shapiro's Cole Slaw in the middle of the meat, grilled to a golden brown, served with our pickle for the perfect blending of flavors in one sandwich!

Our famous Reuben made with our delicious pastrami!

$20.45
No Cryovac here, No processed pieces parts! We start with a brisket of beef, we cook it with our secret spices and rub, and slice it hot when you order your sandwich. About 6 ounces of meat on every sandwich with our famous rye bread, or whatever you choose, creates a huge, two handed meal.

Corned Beef + Brisket Sandwich
$20.75

P.L.T.
$10.75
Pastrami, Lettuce, Tomato sandwich.
We take our fantastic pastrami and cook it into ""bacon"". We add fresh lettuce and a thick slice of tomato; you pick the bread and you have a bargin sandwich in your hands.
Pastrami + Turkey Sandwich
$20.85
Half Shapiro's famous pastrami and half our turkey, you pick smoke or roasted.
Food for thought...the pastrami is hot and the turkey is cold.
Peppered Beef Sandwich
$17.55
Marc Summers from the Food Network did a show where his ""Best thing I Ever Ate"" was Shapiro's Delicatessen's peppered beef. Again, NO Cryovac! It's a cut of beef, but this one is served cold. It's a different taste profile than our corned beef and pastrami. Some like it better, some prefer our hot sandwiches. Who's to say?
Rare Roast Beef Sandwich
$20.45
Another fabulous sandwich that's the best of the best beef category. Our rare roast beef is cooked to a beautiful pink tenderness for a moist treat on any bread. *Please note that this is served cold*. If it were hot, it would no longer be RARE roast beef. For hot roast beef, try our Brisket.
Salami Sandwich
$8.85
We were out of this during the early days of Covid...we were close to a mutiny by our regular customers who LOVE this salami! It is created especially for us by our corned beef supplier Vienna Beef in Chicago. It's our recipe that they make for us. Give it a try.
Roasted/Smoked Turkey Sandwich
$11.40
Smoked or oven roasted, this is a very big seller for Shapiroâs! The Shapiro turkey sandwich has its own cult following. Hormone free and antibiotic free, you can taste why itâs a favorite.
Chopped Liver Sandwich

Two words, chicken schmaltz. We make our own from all of the whole, fresh chickens that we get from Central Indiana and it is the key ingredient in Chopped Liver. You can get a sandwich or a ""schmear"" of chopped liver on top of another sandwich. My favorite is our rye bread heels, crusty and crunchy with a scoop of our creamy and rich chopped liver.
Kosher Style Beef Frank
$6.00
All beef frank without the dyes and strange pieces of cow that the cheap companies include in their hot dogs. Kosher style means that they ""answer to a higher authority"".
Pure Beef Burger
$6.65
This Russian recipe is one of our hidden secrets of the menu. Not for Celiacs, we add bread crumb blends in this amazing value of our menu!
Chicken Salad Sandwich
$10.15
Our chickens are so fresh that they come to us on ice without any plastic or Cryovac processing. Our fresh Indiana chickens are never frozen!!! We cook whole chickens, de-bone them by hand, use the highest level of mayonnaise, grapes, celery and herbs for an amazing scoop of deliciousness! Comes with your choice of bread.
Albacore Tuna Salad Sandwich
$10.15
Our all-white-meat Albacore tuna salad is made with quality fish, with just enough hard-boiled egg whites and seasoning to make a statement of its own. Try it on a flaky croissant with lettuce and tomato.

GENERAL INFO

PARKING:
There is nearby paid on-street metered parking and garages. Given the popularity of the downtown area, it's a good idea to allow extra time for finding parking, especially during peak times. Alternatively, consider using rideshare services or public transportation to avoid parking hassles altogether.
AGE POLICY:
Bring your kids, bring your friends! Fridays & Saturdays are open to all ages until 10pm, but after that, you'll need to be 21 to join the fun.

Daily Menus
Bluebeard is built on the belief that food isn’t a commodity, but a catalyst for community. We have personal relationships with the local and regional farmers and purveyors who provide our meat and produce. These relationships are as essential to the quality of our food as the craft and care that goes into preparing it. Because we focus on what our farmers are the proudest of at the moment, our menu changes a little every day.

Mary Bell:
I ordered takeout. I did the create your own calzone with vegan cheese which was actually really good!! I added lots of veggies too, they have a great selection. This thing was enormous. It has a garlicy slighty crispy outer crust   staff was friendly & the place looked really cute for dine in. I'll definitely be back
Review by - Google
Meg Richmond:
Carry out was super easy to order on the website. The lasagna was delicious and the gluten-free calzone was a big hit with our guest who was excited to see such an extensive gluten free menu. Portions are huge with lots for leftovers and incredibly reasonably priced! We had a little mixup with the order and they were very gracious in making it right. Happy to support local!

Bill Brown:
If you are a pizza lover or spaghetti fan then you should stop in. Spaghetti with marinara, garlic bread salad. Can't go wrong. There are several kinds of bread sticks too. I recommend the Ryan's Breadsticks. Stuffed with cheese and pepperoni. When it's warm enough they offer outdoor seating as well. Lots of menu items.

Brittany Crenshaw:
Not only those this restaurant have some of the best gluten free food ever they also have amazing customer service. I got take out and when I got home saw that they gave me the wrong item. I called them and they delivered it to my house and it was fresh and just made. Awesome!

Jim Brahos:
I dont usually review a restaurant baised on one visit, but this was so good I'll make an exception.  Its a small is joint with that mom and pop feel (I don't know if it really is as I did not see mom or pop) and amazing food. They have all kids of different cheese sticks that are delish along with the usual Italian dishes you would expect...

Q:
Is there corn hole and ping pong inside the Garage or at a different location?
A:
There is a game room next to the Living Room Theatre with pinball, corn hole and ping pong. It is not in the garage but across the walkway. They also have bars in there but still kid friendly.

Bryan Alexander:
Went on a whim...... Glad we did    Fantastic!!   Food is delicious.   Flavor is off the charts.     Very pleasing to the eye on the plate.     Maybe my new favorite place downtown to take a date or for a business dinner.   Far exceeded my expectations.    Don't skip this place .... A gem

Todd Troha:
We had a group in town for the weekend and were fortunate enough to end up at The Flatiron.  We got there late with a group of 10 and they treated us like royalty.

Pooja Gangras:
We had the perfect date here! We ordered from the Devour Indy summerfest menu- bean fritters, pork BLT on grits, pork filet mignon, shrimp and grits, chocolate torte and sticky toffee pudding. The food here is excellent! The flavour of shrimp is so elevated and the chocolate torte is decadent...

Dan Nolan:
We just stumbled upon this place because it started to rain and we were looking for a dinner place. We luckily got the last table. We had a phenomenal dining experience. Great cocktails, great service and awesome food. My wife got the bone in pork chop and we both agreed it was one of the best things we’ve ever eaten...

OUR STORY
The Canal Bistro is the realization of a dream for Mona and George.
George’s homeland is Egypt; Mona spent her first 23 years in Lebanon. They know Mediterranean cooking. George has been in the restaurant business for 22 years. And over the years, Mona watched her mother and grandmother cook for their big family from their own herb and vegetable gardens, learning the value of freshness in cooking.
When she’s not at work Mona’s home cooking up a storm for family and friends. “Our house is known as the ‘fun house’ – huge amounts of food, big parties,” George says. “It’s been our dream to open our own place, to be creative with cuisine, and to have a family business that our sons can be part of.”
The Canal Bistro is that dream. “It’s like you’ve come to one of our parties – we’ve basically just moved our kitchen from home to here,” they say. “We put the grill in the dining room because we want people to know that we are using top quality ingredients, and that freshness is our goal, so everything is done right in front of you.”
So eat up relax be happy. You’re eating in a dream come true!

A:
They sure are! Their hours may differ depending on the day but I usually just look up their hours from their Facebook page.
I’ll also add the link they posted for online ordering and curbside pickup…

Slapfish...well...SLAPS!!!
I have yet to eat something here that didn't leave me satisfied, wondering if I need a box, or thinking ""is it okay to eat a clobster grill cheese for breakfast""?!?
The burrito is massive and you'll enjoy it more if you'll just be honest with yourself that half is for now and half is for later.
The fried pickles are just that...fried PICKLES...not little bitty chips...big old ""I thought you said you liked pickles"" spears! These are actually my favorite appetizer even though they're listed as a side.
-- jon
My favorite thing on the menu is the clobster grilled cheese! It's like someone heard that seafood and cheese didn't mixed and took it personal...went into the kitchen...and came up with the most decadent, buttery, cheesy, and luscious sandwich possible!

Business owner information
Adrian S.
Business Owner
Samano's is more than just Mexican food, it's an escape to México. We want our patrons to feel as if they're eating at a Taquería in the streets of Mexico City!

We may be considered ""fast food"" but everything on our menu is made to order with fresh ingredients. Stop in for our specialty, traditional Mexican style tacos. We offer grilled seasoned chicken, steak, chorizo, or pastor served on warm corn tortillas and topped with cilantro and onion! The Pastor (marinated pork) is slow roasted on a vertical spit with pineapple and onion, exactly how it's prepared in Mexico.

Ever heard of a bacon wrapped burrito? Well we've got one! The Adrian's Burrito is uniquely wrapped in crispy bacon and is sure to conquer even the biggest of appetites!

And the best part? Our salsa bar. With a variety of homemade salsas you can spice up and customize your favorite dish exactly how you like it!

samosa combo
A samosa is a popular savory snack that originated in the Indian subcontinent but has gained widespread popularity across various cuisines and cultures. It is a deep-fried or baked pastry that typically features a crisp, triangular-shaped outer shell made from a mixture of flour, oil, and water.
The filling of a samosa is what truly sets it apart and makes it a delectable treat. Our filling consists of a mixture of spiced potatoes, peas, onions, and a medley of aromatic herbs and spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder.

It's a friendly spot with lots of comfy seating options. The chilli paneer kathi roll I got was packed with flavor and had a crunchy texture from the onion and pepper.

Q:
Does this place actually have a buffet? It is mentioned on the take-home menu, but I do not see anything about it in any of the reviews.
A:
I have been there probably a dozen times and have never seen a buffet at dinner time. But they have been remodeling or it may only be offered at lunch. Call and ask.

Good restaurant, delicious food, classy atmosphere
Ordered samosas, a sweet drink with house-made rice jelly, Burmese pork curry, and mohinga noodle soup. All delicious and fresh!
The samosas were crispy and piping hot, filled with mildly spiced potatos and served with a sweet chili dipping sauce.
The mont let saung drink is a palm sugar syrup with rice flour jelly, topped with coconut and chopped peanuts. The owner said they make the rice jelly at the restaurant! Sweet, cold and refreshing, with a unique flavor.

What our customers say
Reviews
Great food that is fresh and not greasy. For most people, this is a takeout. We drive 10 miles to get our Chinese food there. 5 Stars for the food and service. Highly recommend!!
Michael Gould
The egg rolls are some of the best I've had. Never had a bad experience here. If you are trying to be budget-friendly, most meals can feed 2 people. Ordering carry out is fast and easy.
Sabrena Martin
I've eaten here multiple times. We usually get an orange chicken combo and beef and broccoli and everything is delicious. The 5-stars.  Their customer service was above and beyond!
Lia Kirch
This restaurant is the best. You can not find a good enough restaurant like this one. No matter how hard I tried to find a good Chinese restaurant in Florida nothing could top this one.
Nicholas Willing
This is the best Chinese food I've ever had! I've been going here for probably the past 10 years now and it's still just as good as the first time! A family-oriented place. Overall the best!
Jessie Powers
This will definitely be my go-to spot! The woman who answers the phone and is usually present when I pick up my order is very friendly. Orders have always been correct and fast.

What our customers say
Reviews
Friendly staff and food are always hot and ready when we come to pick it up. Only Chinese takeout that doesn't make me feel like a bloated tick after eating it. And the white rice is the best I've had from takeout too.
Leigh A.
I got shrimp egg foo young with white rice, and my boyfriend chicken with broccoli, and we got crab rangoon. When we got home the food was hot and fresh! It was so good! This will definitely be our new Chinese spot.
Shakeena K.
I'm usually pretty skeptical about Chinese takeout, but this place is fantastic. Fast and very polite service and they do not skip out on portion size! Great prices all around.
JS Williams
This is my favorite Chinese place. I've tried several different items on their menu and have never been disappointed. Great food, friendly and fast service.
Laura D.
I was told by a coworker of this place, that it was good, quick, and delicious. They were absolutely correct. Best Gen. Tso's chicken dish I have ever had, fresh and not expensive at all. I immediately came on here to rate it while I am eating it.
Amor E.
I like this restaurant a lot. Especially the sesame chicken and chicken with broccoli!  The service is nice. The environment is quiet and clean. I'm just traveling here and I am so happy that I find this Chinese restaurant. I will be back if I travel to Indiana again!

Untuk mengaktifkan iklan yang dipersonalisasi (seperti iklan berbasis minat), kami dapat membagikan data Anda dengan mitra pemasaran dan periklanan kami menggunakan cookie dan teknologi lainnya. Mitra tersebut mungkin memiliki informasi mereka sendiri yang telah mereka kumpulkan tentang Anda.

The Churrasco Experience
For more than a century, the Culinary Art of Churrasco, or cooking over an open flame,
                              has been skillfully mastered by the Gaucho Chefs of Brazil. Our Gauchos carefully
                              butcher, simply season and fire-roast each cut to seal in the natural flavors, producing
                              a salty bark and creating a unique and unforgettable culinary experience.

Q:
Is this a swingers bar?
A:
I've never heard of it referred to in that way, nor has my significant other (who has bowled with the Chatterbox league). Just a fun place for a drink & live music!

Weight Loss Efficacy: Measuring
Generic Xenical
‘s Success. When considering whether to buy generic Xenical, one cannot dismiss its track record in helping individuals shed pounds. The generic version, just like its brand-name counterpart, contains orlistat, which works by preventing the absorption of some of the fat from the food you eat, leading to a caloric deficit which is necessary for weight loss. Studies demonstrate its effectiveness, particularly when paired with a low-calorie diet and regular physical activity, bolstering the drug’s reputation as a facilitator rather than a sole solution.

About Us
Bio
Steven J. Oakley, Chef/Proprietor
It’s commonly thought that you know you’ve found your life’s calling if you’d do your job for free. Chef Steven J. Oakley personifies that idea. His career began at age 16 when he offered his services to a suburban Chicago restaurant for free: “I just wanted to work, I wanted to learn,” says Oakley. That emphasis on hard work and continual learning has culminated in Chef Oakley arriving at the top of his profession in Indianapolis.
That structured education didn’t temper his need to learn from other chefs in other kitchens and he spent many weekends traveling to New York City to work in some of the most prestigious restaurants in the country, including The Park Avenue Café and Lutece–for free of course. He spent summers back in Chicago where he worked at the famous Charlie Trotter’s. Following a brief stint at the Scottsdale Princess Resort in Arizona, Chef Oakley returned home to Chicago where he worked for another landmark restaurant, Printer’s Row, and again, Charlie Trotter’s.
Benvenuti, a venerable Indianapolis eatery, called him away from the windy city for good. He spent a year there before joining forces with Something Different Restaurant in 1993, where he spent nine years receiving many accolades including nominations for the prestigious James Beard Rising Star Chef’s award and the restaurant’s induction into the Restaurant Hall of Fame.
And now, as Chef/Proprietor of OAKLEYS bistro, which he established in December 2002, he is living his childhood dream and hoping to help others do the same. An unpretentious, neighborhood American bistro is very different from the haute cuisine establishments of Chef Oakley’s previous experiences. Put in his words, “We wanted to dispel the notion that special food should be reserved for special occasions: we created an affordable, everyday destination where every meal is a special occasion.”
Achieving such recognition as being named “one of the hottest restaurants from coast to coast” by Bon Appétit, receiving the American Culinary Federation’s National Achievement of Excellence Award, and “Restaurant of the Year” and “Superstar” from the Indianapolis Monthly Magazine, OAKLEYS bistro reflects its owner’s passion for food and sharing it with others. But Chef Oakley’s sharing goes beyond the traditional, evidenced by the Restaurant & Hospitality Association’s Neighborhood Award to “honor restaurant operators who go above and beyond supporting their communities.” The Association specifically recognized that not only does Oakleys bistro contribute a portion of its sales of products to Second Helpings, Indianapolis’ only food rescue, job training and hunger relief program, but also Chef Oakley opens his kitchen for training and hiring those who demonstrate a true passion for food and who understand the demands placed on a first class kitchen team.
From capturing first place at the Food Network—Simon Mall’s “Super Chefs Live” competition and being invited as a guest chef for Cakebread Cellars’ American Harvest Dinners and Epcot’s International Food & Wine Festival to being named one of Indy’s Best and Brightest by the business community and honored for the past several years as a semifinalist in the James Beard Foundation’s Best Chefs in America Awards, Chef Oakley most cherishes the accolades from those who join him and his Team for lunch and dinner at OAKLEYS bistro. When asked to what he attributes his success, Chef Oakley responds, “You have to love what you do.” He does—and it shows.

Slapfish...well...SLAPS!!!
I have yet to eat something here that didn't leave me satisfied, wondering if I need a box, or thinking ""is it okay to eat a clobster grill cheese for breakfast""?!?
The burrito is massive and you'll enjoy it more if you'll just be honest with yourself that half is for now and half is for later.
The fried pickles are just that...fried PICKLES...not little bitty chips...big old ""I thought you said you liked pickles"" spears! These are actually my favorite appetizer even though they're listed as a side.
-- jon
My favorite thing on the menu is the clobster grilled cheese! It's like someone heard that seafood and cheese didn't mixed and took it personal...went into the kitchen...and came up with the most decadent, buttery, cheesy, and luscious sandwich possible!

Let your server know of any allergies the kitchen should be aware of when composing your dish.
Also, consuming raw or undercooked meats, poultry, seafood, shellfish, eggs or unpasteurized milk may increase your risk of foodborne illness. But you already knew that, right?
sdik
garden gate $9
beet, carrot, apple, celery, lemon, turmeric, ginger, black pepper
We call this the gateway juice because it’s vibrant, sweet, soothing, and approachable.
Beets oxygenate and strengthen the blood, carrots ward off infections with their
abundance of vitamin A, lemon and celery detoxify the liver, turmeric reduces
inflammation, and ginger calms the nervous system. The hint of black pepper does
more than complete the flavor profile, it supports absorption of the fresh
turmeric root.
neon nectar
$9
orange, carrot, apple, lemon, turmeric, ginger
Not your common orange juice, this lively blend is the ideal morning starter,
brimming in vitamins and antioxidants. Boost your immune system with an abundant
amount of Vitamin C combined with anti-inflammatory turmeric.
detox dream
$9
filtered H2O, lemon, maple, ginger, activated charcoal, cayenne
Flush your system with powerful detoxifying agents to reduce bloating and cleanse
the liver. Feel energized from the natural sugars in maple syrup. Be sure only to drink
Detox Dream on an empty stomach, as activated charcoal is like a sponge, and will
disrupt the absorbency of nutrients from your food as it pushes the toxins out.
cashew concoction $9
filtered H2O, coconut water, cashew, spirulina, maple, vanilla
bean, Himalayan pink sea salt
A luscious blend of raw cashews, hydrating coconut water, sweet maple syrup, as
well as mineral–rich and detoxifying spirulina provide a boost of protein and essential
fatty acids that help to repair tissue, regulate blood sugar levels, and promote satiety.
A pinch of pink sea salt promotes circulation and pH balance, and deepens the
intoxicating flavors of this creamy beverage.
hoosier heater
$9
apple, orange, spinach, kale, cilantro, jalapeño, lime
This sweet and spicy blend revs your metabolism, shifting calorie burn into
high gear. The citrus promotes a strong immune system and aids in tissue repair,
jalapeño stimulates circulation, and cilantro strengthens your bones.
tropic tonic
$9
pineapple, kale, spinach, parsley, lemon, aloe, mint
This refreshing, tropical, and enzyme-rich tonic supports gut health with its heavy
dose of pineapple’s bromelain enzyme. Parsley oxygenates the blood to enhance
circulation, and fresh aloe juice supports hydration, digestive regularity, and brings
a healthy glow to your skin.
emerald elixir
$9
romaine, cucumber, celery, kale, spinach, lemon, ginger,
turmeric, Himalayan pink sea salt, black pepper
Our take on green lemonade is tangy, crisp, and thirst quenching.
The greens pack in antioxidants and enzymes, lemon detoxifies the liver and
brightens skin, and ginger and turmeric reduce inflammation. Not only does
Himalayan sea salt add vibrancy and tame any notorious “green” after taste, it
promotes balanced pH. The black pepper aids in turmeric absorption.
lush love $9
watermelon, ruby red grapefruit, coconut water, lime, basil
Refreshing and slimming due to a robust metabolism rev, this sweet and aromatic
juice revitalizes while boosting immunity and heart health. The subtle hint of
antioxidant-rich basil is a compatible counterpart to succulent watermelon and
coconut water.
cold pressed juice flight $11
Four 5oz pours of your choosing

Diego C:
This was an amazing place! The burgers were super juicy (I ordered rare cook), and the bun had a perfect texture. The bacon was on point, and cheddar cheese was fabulous. Service was excellent, and atmosphere too. Prices are very fair for the size of the plates. I will definitely come back again.

Finally got a chance to check out the new location and was very happy I did. The staff was super friendly and the beer was really really good. They even walked around and gave free samples of a batch they just tapped which I thought was pretty awesome.

This is a great little brew pub! I stoped by on my way through town and found good food and beer and great service. I particularly enjoyed the black and blue salad and the Lucid IPA. Great work Brew Link!
