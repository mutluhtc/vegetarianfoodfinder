Our
inspiration
In 1920, on a ship named The Italia, my grandparents
traveled from Calabria, Italy to Philadelphia
with only a few pennies in their pockets.
Francesco and Tommasina Rocchino
worked incredibly hard, raised a large
family, loved their South Philadelphia
neighborhood deeply, and never
hesitated to lend a hand to fellow
immigrants especially during the war.
Over time they built two successful
businesses, Rocchino & Sons a corner
deli & grocery store legendary for
grandmom’s fresh pastas & sandwiches,
and a construction company through which
my grandpop built many of the
neighborhood’s row houses with
great attention to detail and quality.
My grandparents and their beautiful daughter Rosemary LaScala, my mother, are my inspiration every day! I honor their passion, their integrity, and their drive in all I do.
On behalf of my team at the LaScala
Restaurant
Group and I, we thank you
for making it
possible for us to do
what we love…we hope to
see you soon,
let’s eat!

Chef Michael Vincent Ferreri moved to Philadelphia in 2011 where he worked for acclaimed chefs such as Jose Garces at Tinto, Michael Solomonov at Zahav, and Joey Baldino at Zeppoli. It was at Zeppoli that the seed of Ferreri’s love affair with treating beautiful ingredients simply started to blossom into his expression of Modern Sicilian Cuisine. After opening Aldine with Chef George Sabatino, Ferreri moved on to write his first menu at Res Ipsa. The years at Res Ipsa were the sounding board for many accolades to come.
In 2017 Res Ipsa was named among Bon Appetit’s Top 50 Best New Restaurants. In March 2019 Ferreri fulfilled a lifelong dream to cook a beautiful meal in the kitchen at The James Beard House, for none other occasion than The Feast of Saint Giussepe. Also in 2019 Ferreri was named among Philadelphia’s Star Chefs Rising Stars. In our first year open at Irwin’s, 2021, Esquire named Irwin’s as one of the Best New Restaurants in America. Just a year later in 2022, Bon Appetit recognized Irwin’s as one of the top 10 Best New Restaurants.
Chef Michael Vincent Ferreri’s cuisine celebrates the seasons and the farmers that harvest the best of their terroir. Ferreri is thrilled to find a home at Irwin’s, and to showcase his love for natural wine. The menu highlights seafood, hand made pasta, and the traditions of Sicily.

“Pizzeria Salvy is my father’s Philadelphia story. It’s a story of persistence and perseverance. It’s a story of my childhood, and all the flavors and experiences I remember.” – Marc Vetri
The latest from acclaimed Chef Marc Vetri, Pizzeria Salvy borrows its name from Marc’s beloved father, Sal. “My father has been at the center of everything when it comes to my restaurant career,” says Marc. “From the meatballs to the family meals he has made for the last 25 years, it’s only fitting that we dedicate this project to him.
Pizzeria Salvy offers a curated selection of 12-inch pizzas, as well as specialty taglio slices. Salads, seasonal vegetables, and (of course) Sal’s Meatballs round out a menu inspired by heritage and heart, family and Philadelphia.
Sal's Rules to Live By
Always work for yourself - no matter what, be the boss.
Always use veal, pork and beef in meatballs.
Always have integrity - you are only as good as your word.

About the Business
Harvest Seasonal Grill features a local, farm to table menu with many items that are below 500 calories in an upscale casual atmosphere. Every three months, we update our menu to celebrate the new flavors that accompany the change in seasons. We also offer 50+ wines by the glass, as well as a growing selection of local and organic beers.

At Harvest, we believe that where your food comes from is as important as what you eat, which is why we champion the ideology of 'know your farmer, know your food'. We work with over 75 local farmers to source the freshest and highest quality products available. Our mission of sustainability and green living is carried through every facet of what we do, from our menu to our decor, and even the cleaning products that we use are eco-friendly.

Q:
Is it good for kids?
A:
Hi Evelyn, I found the casual atmosphere was very accommodating for all age levels. It is a bit tight so I would encourage they stay seated. You will want to get there!

Dinner Menu
Our dinner menu brings together comforting Italian classics with a modern flair. Begin with antipasti such as crispy eggplant, calamari fritti, or PEI mussels, then move into hearty pastas and entrées, from parmigiana three ways to rigatoni alla vodka,
braised short rib, and roasted market fish.
The second half of the menu leans into indulgent flavors and seasonal pairings, featuring whipped ricotta toast, arancini, and roasted pork belly alongside signature pastas like cacio e pepe, squid ink spaghetti, and lumache bolognese. Elevated mains, including pan-seared scallops and NY strip, highlight bold, seasonal ingredients. Sundays are reserved for our all-day simmered Sunday Gravy, the ultimate expression of Italian comfort.

As bright and boisterous as a joy ride in a Tijuana taxi, El Vez exudes fun at every conceivable turn.
The flashy, frenetic Latin decor, featuring high-backed velvet Hollywood booths and an eye-popping low-rider bike elevated above the dining room, creates the perfect conditions for memorable food and drink. Unexpected interpretations of Mexican classics join traditional cooking on the expansive menu, complemented by a bar that boasts one of the biggest tequila selections — and the best margaritas — in the city. Striking the ideal balance between a south-of-the-border celebration and a hot and flashy Las Vegas blowout, El Vez is the embodiment of Mex-Eclectic spirit.
Group Dining

• Seating is available in the Main Dining Room for groups up to 75 people.

ABOUT
Amá, from Mexico City-born chef Frankie Ramirez, and partners, is an elevated Mexican restaurant in Philadelphia’s Fishtown/Kensington neighborhood.
    Located at 101 West Oxford Street, Amá is open seven days a week for dinner and features a full bar program with craft
    cocktails and a heavy focus on tequila and mezcal. The menu is seasonal, featuring hand-pressed tortillas and 20-plus items inspired by the six main
    culinary regions of Mexico, which include the Yucatán Peninsula, the Pacific coast, northern Mexico,
    central Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Baja region. Most of the menu, which rotates seasonally,
    is cooked on live fire and intended to be shareable. Appetizers include a variety of tacos, tostadas, crudos, ceviches, and aguachile, and seasonal
    vegetarian options that will be prepared on a custom eight-foot-long charcoal and wood-fired grill
    from M&M BBQ Company in Texas, with Ramirez using both charcoal and wood to cook premium
    proteins and fresh vegetables. House-made desserts will contain nostalgic flavors that virtually transport guests to Mexico.

Q:
We received an ad that says ""Dine in and enjoy free margaritas with your meal."" Do they serve you one per meal or are they endless? Are these with alcohol or do we bring our own tequila?  Same question about the pitcher, I assume it's byo tequilla?
A:
Hey there! Thanks for inquiring about our restaurant! We offer 1  complimentary Margarita to go with your Entree (Please remember to ask your server for one!) We are also BYOB and have Margarita Mix- regular.  Thank you and hope to see you soon!

Our Producers
We believe that no dish can be better than its ingredients and that the best ingredients are usually local.
Every day we make many decisions about what we eat and every one of our food choices has an ethical and environmental impact.
It is the best of coincidences that good food choices – those that are good for our land and people, for the environment, for the body and mind – are also delicious and enjoyable.
Our Food Philosophy
We believe that no dish can be better than its ingredients and that the best ingredients are usually local. As great cooking starts with great ingredients, great ingredients start with great farmers.

Premium Ingredients.
Endless Choice.
Your choice to add toppings to any meal, like sautéed veggies, sour cream, jalapeños, and more. If gluten isn’t in your diet, skip our tortillas. If you’re highly sensitive to gluten, we’ll gladly change our gloves for you. You should be aware that some items containing corn, including our blue corn tortilla chips and corn salsa, may have a small amount of gluten from potentially co-mingling with gluten-containing grains in crop fields.

The food here is delicious and the staff was very pleasant. There was not one thing that we ordered that we were unsatisfied with. Wasn't over priced either. Will definitely be back.

January 2016
My friend and I got the livingsocial deal which was 3 courses including specialty naan for two people for $40. Given that most buffet places are $10-15, I thought paying the extra for a sit down place with 3 courses would be nice.
Appetizers: Aloo Chaat and Coconut Cauliflower. Aloo Chaat was your traditional chaat (tortilla like chip strips, garbanzo beans, and some sauces) which I enjoyed as an appetizer. Coconut cauliflower was drenched in coconut chutney AND coconut oil. The oil made me sick in a way and the overpowering coconut taste I didn't care for. Even when I took it home and tried to mix it with rice I couldn't finish it.
Entree-My friend ordered the lamb and I ordered the paneer something. My item was not oily and spicy! Just the way I like my Indian food! Next time I would go with someone vegetarian so I can try two curries, I generally like eating more than 1 with my food. Heard the lamb was delicious.
Naan-Garlic and Chili Naans were made tandoori style aka in an oven sans butter. This is good in the sense that the naan wasn't drenched in butter but it is definitely different. Crispy and not as soft. I guess I prefer mine on the stove softer.. The garlic got burned the way they cooked it.
Dessert-Rasmali Tiramusi. YUM!
Definitely would order here again for takeout/delivery. That seems to be their main revenue source as no one was in the restaurant. If you see this livingsocial deal, I would def snag it. Each entrÃ©e item is $12-15 so $20 for the whole thing is a steal.
For Indian food in the city, I like it!

Indian brunch for the win!
We got here on a Saturday morning around 11:30, and were seated immediately. We were there about 45 minutes before the place was full. I say that to say, either come early or make reservations. The place is BEAUTIFUL, and family friendly. We saw couples, families, and young folks all hanging out together.
Once you get here and seated, the service is attentive and kind. Our server, Josh, was good about answering questions, and providing suggestions, which made choosing from the expansive menu much easier. We had lovely rose mimosas, and I had the vindaloo egg skillet. The grilled challah is really delicious! My bestie got the poutine, which is billed as an appetizer, but you can totally eat it as a meal with the cheese, meat, and potatoes.
The pricing here is a taaad high, but between the setting, service, and scrumptious food, treat yourself and give it a shot!

FAQs
See more FAQs
How do I transfer to another registrar such as GoDaddy?
Yes, you can transfer your domain to any registrar or hosting company once you have purchased it. Since domain transfers are a manual process, it can take up to 5 days to transfer the domain.
Domains purchased with payment plans are not eligible to transfer until all payments have been made. Please remember that our 30-day money back guarantee is void once a domain has been transferred.
For transfer instructions to GoDaddy, please

.
How do I get the domain after the purchase?
Once you purchase the domain we will push it into an account for you at our registrar, NameBright.com, we will then send you an email with your NameBright username and password. In most cases access to the domain will be available within one to two hours of purchase, however access to domains purchased after business hours will be available within the next business day.
What comes with the domain name?
Nothing else is included with the purchase of the domain name. Our registrar NameBright.com does offer email packages for a yearly fee, however you will need to find hosting and web design services on your own.
Do you offer payment plans?
Yes we offer payment plans for up to 12 months.
See details
.
How do I keep my personal information private?
If you wish the domain ownership information to be private, add WhoIs Privacy Protection to your domain. This hides your personal information from the general public.
To add privacy protection to your domain, do so within your registrar account. NameBright offers WhoIs Privacy Protection for free for the first year, and then for a small fee for subsequent years.
Whois information is not updated immediately. It typically takes several hours for Whois data to update, and different registrars are faster than others. Usually your Whois information will be fully updated within two days.

The food here is delicious and the staff was very pleasant. There was not one thing that we ordered that we were unsatisfied with. Wasn't over priced either. Will definitely be back.

January 2016
My friend and I got the livingsocial deal which was 3 courses including specialty naan for two people for $40. Given that most buffet places are $10-15, I thought paying the extra for a sit down place with 3 courses would be nice.
Appetizers: Aloo Chaat and Coconut Cauliflower. Aloo Chaat was your traditional chaat (tortilla like chip strips, garbanzo beans, and some sauces) which I enjoyed as an appetizer. Coconut cauliflower was drenched in coconut chutney AND coconut oil. The oil made me sick in a way and the overpowering coconut taste I didn't care for. Even when I took it home and tried to mix it with rice I couldn't finish it.
Entree-My friend ordered the lamb and I ordered the paneer something. My item was not oily and spicy! Just the way I like my Indian food! Next time I would go with someone vegetarian so I can try two curries, I generally like eating more than 1 with my food. Heard the lamb was delicious.
Naan-Garlic and Chili Naans were made tandoori style aka in an oven sans butter. This is good in the sense that the naan wasn't drenched in butter but it is definitely different. Crispy and not as soft. I guess I prefer mine on the stove softer.. The garlic got burned the way they cooked it.
Dessert-Rasmali Tiramusi. YUM!
Definitely would order here again for takeout/delivery. That seems to be their main revenue source as no one was in the restaurant. If you see this livingsocial deal, I would def snag it. Each entrÃ©e item is $12-15 so $20 for the whole thing is a steal.
For Indian food in the city, I like it!

Indian brunch for the win!
We got here on a Saturday morning around 11:30, and were seated immediately. We were there about 45 minutes before the place was full. I say that to say, either come early or make reservations. The place is BEAUTIFUL, and family friendly. We saw couples, families, and young folks all hanging out together.
Once you get here and seated, the service is attentive and kind. Our server, Josh, was good about answering questions, and providing suggestions, which made choosing from the expansive menu much easier. We had lovely rose mimosas, and I had the vindaloo egg skillet. The grilled challah is really delicious! My bestie got the poutine, which is billed as an appetizer, but you can totally eat it as a meal with the cheese, meat, and potatoes.
The pricing here is a taaad high, but between the setting, service, and scrumptious food, treat yourself and give it a shot!

Cheeto Whitman
Iâve ordered take out from here a couple times, and the food has always been good. The garlic naan and rice are on point, and the paneer dishes Iâve ordered have been very flavourful. Just wish there was a bit more paneer, but I know cheese is expensive right now.
azmi fatima
We visited for the lunch buffet and were thoroughly impressed. There was a wide variety of authentic Desi dishes, all cooked to perfection. The spice levels were just right throughout the entire meal, striking a perfect balance of flavor and heat.
Tracey Holland
I ordered online, Sunday, March 23rd. When I got to the restaurant about 9:15pm, they said that they didn't have my order. So, I called Beyond menu customer service and she said she would call the restaurant and call me right back. I believe the owner came out, and asked me if I had the right restaurant. So I left,
...
the man  I believed was the owner, came outside to get me, while the lady from customer service called me, to say that, they would make my food. When I got back inside, he told me to sit down, it would be a few minutes. It was 9:40 and they close at 10pm, but my food was smelling really good. So, when the man came out of the kitchen to hand me my food, he had this big smile on his face, like he knew that food was good and that I would be back. He was correct! It tasted just as good as it smelled. I ordered the chili chicken and chicken biryani and it was the best I have tasted. There is an Indian restaurant near my house, it's good, but it's not better than Royal indian cuisine. I will definitely be back!

Great flavors, lamb and chicken were both tender. Dessert wasn't too sweet but satisfied our cravings.

Overall a great experience, especially since they were the only restaurants opened late on Christmas Eve!

The food here is delicious and the staff was very pleasant. There was not one thing that we ordered that we were unsatisfied with. Wasn't over priced either. Will definitely be back.

My friend and I got the livingsocial deal which was 3 courses including specialty naan for two people for $40. Given that most buffet places are $10-15, I thought paying the extra for a sit down place with 3 courses would be nice.
Appetizers: Aloo Chaat and Coconut Cauliflower. Aloo Chaat was your traditional chaat (tortilla like chip strips, garbanzo beans, and some sauces) which I enjoyed as an appetizer. Coconut cauliflower was drenched in coconut chutney AND coconut oil. The oil made me sick in a way and the overpowering coconut taste I didn't care for. Even when I took it home and tried to mix it with rice I couldn't finish it.
Entree-My friend ordered the lamb and I ordered the paneer something. My item was not oily and spicy! Just the way I like my Indian food! Next time I would go with someone vegetarian so I can try two curries, I generally like eating more than 1 with my food. Heard the lamb was delicious.
Naan-Garlic and Chili Naans were made tandoori style aka in an oven sans butter. This is good in the sense that the naan wasn't drenched in butter but it is definitely different. Crispy and not as soft. I guess I prefer mine on the stove softer.. The garlic got burned the way they cooked it.
Dessert-Rasmali Tiramusi. YUM!
Definitely would order here again for takeout/delivery. That seems to be their main revenue source as no one was in the restaurant. If you see this livingsocial deal, I would def snag it. Each entrÃ©e item is $12-15 so $20 for the whole thing is a steal.
For Indian food in the city, I like it!

Indian brunch for the win!
We got here on a Saturday morning around 11:30, and were seated immediately. We were there about 45 minutes before the place was full. I say that to say, either come early or make reservations. The place is BEAUTIFUL, and family friendly. We saw couples, families, and young folks all hanging out together.
Once you get here and seated, the service is attentive and kind. Our server, Josh, was good about answering questions, and providing suggestions, which made choosing from the expansive menu much easier. We had lovely rose mimosas, and I had the vindaloo egg skillet. The grilled challah is really delicious! My bestie got the poutine, which is billed as an appetizer, but you can totally eat it as a meal with the cheese, meat, and potatoes.
The pricing here is a taaad high, but between the setting, service, and scrumptious food, treat yourself and give it a shot!

Discover Story
the Restaurant
We started as a Halal Lunch truck in University City on 38th and Spruce. At the time, zabiha halal meat wasn't available in Philadelphia, so Saad took matters into his hands, and slaughtered cows and sheep himself and sometimes skinned them to get the job done.
Some restaurants are selective with their zabiha halal menu, but we take pride in providing an all zabiha halal menu to our customers, that's how we like to treat ourselves, and we treat our customers the same way.
We close for the Friday prayers because it's an obligation to attend the Jumaa' prayer; and it's an obligation to fast during the month of Ramadan, so we take a break and we close for a month for the sake of Allah.
We make everything from scratch, that's why everything we make is fresh and tastes so good.
Awards and Mentions
Here are some awards that we are honored to accept and Mentions that we are humbled to be part of.

Peking Roast Duck is one of the famous local dishes in Beijing. There are several ways to roast duck, but the roasting method of “Hanging Oven Roast Duck” is called Beijing roast duck.

About the Business
Dim Sum literally means “touching the heart” in Chinese language. It is typically served in a small plate so it also means “snack” or “small sample”. This unique culinary treasure originated in China many hundreds of years ago and is a showcase of China’s rich culinary diversity and history . Although Dim Sum is popularly regarded as Cantonese cuisine, it actually originated in Northern China as an exclusive luxury for the royal family, and eventually it was served in tea houses, particularly the busy tea houses along the famous Silk Road, where merchants and local elites met and socialized.

Dim Sum can be enjoyed on any occasion, as appetizer, starter, lunch, snack, or even as a main course or dessert.

We at Dim Sum & Noodle serve well prepared Dim Sum for your enjoyment and excitement of this Chinese culinary treasure hunt and journey.

Terms and Conditions
Terms and Conditions (""Terms"")
Last updated: Jan 6, 2019
Please read these Terms and Conditions (""Terms"", ""Agreement"", ""Terms and
									Conditions"") carefully before using the https://www.cartana.net
									https://cartana.co, the web sites created for the restaurants or stores (""Vendor"") that fulfill the orders, 
									the Cartana mobile applications and the Cartana POS devices (the ""Services"", ""the Sites"")
									operated by Cartana LLC (""Cartana"").
Your access to and
									use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and
									compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors,
									users and others who access or use the Service.
By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these
										Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may
										not access the Services.
Conditions of Use
1. Using the Services
You may only use the Services to order if you are the authorized
									holder of the credit card used for payment or an authorized
									user of a corporate account and if you are able to form a
									binding contract with us. In addition, if you are a minor in
									the jurisdiction in which you reside (generally under the age
									of 18), you must have the permission of, and be directly
									supervised by, your parent or legal guardian to use the Service,
									and your parent or legal guardian must read and agree to this
									Agreement prior to your using the Service. Notwithstanding the
									foregoing, you are prohibited from using the Service if you are
									under the age of 13.
Use of the Sites to order
									requires that you register and/or create an account
									(""Account""). To register and create an Account, you must create
									a username and password and provide certain personal
									information. In consideration of the use of the Sites'
									services, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and
									complete information about yourself as prompted by the
									registration form, and (b) maintain and promptly update the
									personal information you provide to keep it true, accurate,
									current and complete. If you provide any information that is
									untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Cartana has
									reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue,
									inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Cartana has the right to
									block your current or future use of the Sites (or any portion
									thereof).
You are responsible for maintaining the
									confidentiality and security of your Account and password and
									for all activities or any other actions that occur under or are
									taken in connection with your password or Account. You agree to
									(a) immediately notify Cartana of any known or suspected
									unauthorized use(s) of your password or Account, or any known
									or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or
									unauthorized disclosure of your password or credit card
									information; and (b) ensure that you exit from your Account at
									the end of each session. Cartana will not be liable for any
									injury, loss or damage of any kind arising from or relating to
									your failure to comply with (a) and (b) or for any acts or
									omissions by you or someone else using your Account and/or
									password.
2. Pickup and Delivery Orders
When you place a Pickup or Delivery Order, you may choose
									the time you would like your Order to be picked up or delivered
									to you. This time is only an estimate and Cartana offers no
									guarantee by this time. Cartana is not responsible for any
									delays in receiving your Order for any reason. If you have
									ordered alcohol, you must be of legal age to consume alcohol in
									the area in which the alcohol is delivered. The right is
									reserved of Vendor to require, valid government-issued photo
									identification, matching the name on the order, proving your
									age to the courier and that the recipient will not be
									intoxicated when receiving delivery. If you are unable to meet
									these conditions to the satisfaction of the Merchant then
									delivery of the alcohol products will be withheld, and any
									refund for such withholding is solely at the discretion of the
									Vendor.
3. Payment Methods
For the online ordering, we accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and
									Discover credit card if the Vendor chooses online payment. In order to protect our customers from
									credit card fraud, the billing address on your order form must
									match the billing address to which your monthly credit card
									statement is mailed. All Cartana online transactions are
									secured with industry-standard SSL data encryption that
									supports 128-bit encryption. If an order is not paid online, you must pay at the restaurant or pay the driver who delivers
									the order. You are obligated to pay for the order you made using the Sites unless the Vendor cancels the order.
4. Credit Policy
Unless prohibited by law, in the event of any error in
									your order or the amount you were charged, you are entitled to
									a credit, provided it is brought to our attention within 60
									days of your order date. If you do not raise the issue within
									60 days of your order date, you waive the ability to receive a
									credit for any error.
5. Communications from Cartana
If you use our Sites and Services, Cartana may
									communicate with you via voice call, electronic messages, including email,
									text message/SMS, or mobile push notifications in accordance
									with our privacy policy. If you make an order using the Sites, a valid phone number (either voice or smart phone) must be provided. 
									When you provide a phone number, you agree that Cartana can perform a certian validation process such as an automatic voice call or a text message to your phone.
6. Technical Requirements
Use of the Services requires Internet access through your
									computer or mobile device. You are responsible for all mobile
									carrier data or text message charges resulting from your use of
									the Services, including from any notifications provided by the
									Services. In order to use the text message based services, you
									must maintain an active account with a carrier of electronic
									communications through mobile devices and you may not use a
									prepaid cellular phone to access such text message services.
									Cartana does not guarantee that the Services will be compatible
									with all devices or will be supported by all mobile carriers.
									You may be required to have JavaScript (or similar
									technologies) enabled to use the Sites.

									modify the Services from time to time and without notice,
									including, without limitation, by removing, adding, or

									the foregoing actions. If you object to any such changes, your
									sole recourse shall be to cease using the Services. Continued
									use of the Services following any such changes shall indicate
									your acknowledgment of such changes and satisfaction with all
									the Services.

Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
Updated and Effective Jan 6, 2019
We are concerned about privacy issues and want you to be
							familiar with how we collect, use and disclose Personal
							Information (as defined below). This Privacy Policy describes our
							practices in connection with privacy and the Personal Information
							that we collect through the web sites, www.cartana.net, cartana.co, all the web sites hosted by Cartana 
							for participating restaurants or businesses, the related
							Cartana mobile apps or devices, and selected other
							domains (collectively, the ""Sites""). Except as indicated below,
							this Privacy Policy does not address the collection, use or
							disclosure of information by us or by third parties on any
							web sites other than the Sites. As used in this Agreement,
							""Cartana"", ""we,"" ""us,"" and ""our"" shall mean Cartana LLC.
By accessing and/or using the Sites, you agree to all the
							terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree
							to all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, do not
							use the Sites. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to
							time and without prior notice, except that if we make a material
							change, we will notify you prior to the effective date of the
							change. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective as soon
							as they are posted, unless a later Effective Date is provided. By
							continuing to access and/or use the Sites after the Effective
							Date of a revised Privacy Policy, you agree to be bound by the
							revised Privacy Policy. For clarity, if you do not agree to the
							new terms of the Privacy Policy, do not continue using the Sites.
							The most current version of this policy will always be posted on
							the Sites.
1.What Types of Information Do We and Our Third Party
							Service Providers Collect From You?
Personal Information
is information such as your name,
							tied to a postal address, telephone number, email address, and
							date of birth, or other data that, when taken together, can
							uniquely identify you. Personal Information also includes certain
							sensitive information related to your finances or, for business
							accounts, related to the finances of your employer, such as a
							credit card number or other payment account number (including the
							three (3) or four (4) digit validation code for your credit
							card). In order for you to take advantage of the services
							provided through the Sites, we may require that you furnish
							Personal Information or, for business accounts, that your
							employer furnish Personal Information for you. We and our third
							party service providers collect your Personal Information when
							you voluntarily provide it to us or, for business accounts, when
							your employer provides it to us.
Non-Personal Information
(or
""Non-PII""
) is
							aggregated information, demographic information and any other
							information that does not uniquely identify you. We and our third
							party service providers may collect your Non-Personal
							Information, including information about the device you are using
							in accessing and/or using the Sites, information from referring
							web sites, and your interaction with the Sites. We and our third
							party service providers may also aggregate Personal Information
							in a manner such that the end-product does not uniquely identify
							you or any other user of the Sites, for example, by using
							Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who
							have a particular telephone area code. This collective
							information constitutes Non-Personal Information.
Cookies and Other Technology
A cookie is a small piece of
							data that is sent by the Sites to your Internet browser and stored
							on your computer's hard drive, and that delivers information
							about you and your activity on the Sites. Pixel tags and web
							beacons are small graphic files that can function in various ways
							(such as allowing us to track how you view an email that we send
							you, and track your activity on the Sites) and are commonly used
							in conjunction with cookies. We, our third party service
							providers and other third parties detailed below under ""How Do We
							and Our Third Party Service Providers Use Information Collected
							From You?"" may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other
							similar technologies to better serve you with more tailored
							information and to facilitate your ongoing use of the Sites. If
							you do not want information collected through the use of cookies,
							there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to
							decline the use of cookies.
IP Addresses are the Internet Protocol addresses of the
								computers that you are using.
Your IP Address is automatically
							assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet
							Service Provider (ISP) and is identified and logged automatically
							in our server log files whenever you visit the Sites, along with
							the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) of the Sites that
							you visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the
							Internet and is done automatically by many websites.
Location Information.
We may obtain information about your
							physical location, such as by use of GPS and other geolocation
							features in your device, or by inference from other information
							we collect. For example, your IP Address indicates the general
							geographic region from which you are connecting to the Internet.
2.How Do We and Our Third Party Service Providers Use
							Information Collected From You?
Personal Information.
We and our third party service
							providers may use your Personal Information and any third party's
							Personal Information that you may provide, as applicable:
to process your registration on our
								Sites, including verifying your information to ensure its
								accuracy and validity.
to fulfill your requests (e.g., to
								allow you to order food through our restaurant partners and have
								it delivered to you, or to provide you with information that you
								request).
to fulfill your purchases (e.g., to
								process credit card payments in connection with your food
								order).
to customize content on our Sites
								(e.g., the restaurants that will deliver to your location).
to send you important information
								regarding the Sites, such as certain changes to our terms,
								conditions, policies and/or other administrative information.
								Because this information may be material to your use of the
								Sites, you may not opt out of receiving such communications.
to inform you of products,
								programs, services and promotions that we believe may be of
								interest to you and to permit you to participate in sweepstakes,
								contests and similar promotions (collectively, ""Promotions"").
to permit you to refer us to your
								friends so that we may send them a promotional offer through the
								Sites. If you wish to use this feature, you may be required to
								provide us with, and we may use, your friend's name and email
								address. By using this functionality, you affirm that you are
								entitled to use and provide us with your friend's name and email
								address for this purpose. We will not use your friend's Personal
								Information for any purpose other than to allow a promotional
								offer to be sent and/or to troubleshoot any issues with respect
								such promotional offer, unless we disclose such other purpose to
								you at the time you provide your friend's Personal Information
								to us.
for our internal business purposes,
								such as data analysis, audits, developing new products,
								enhancing our website, improving our services, identifying usage
								trends and determining the effectiveness of our promotional
								campaigns.
for purposes disclosed at the time
								you provide your Personal Information or as otherwise set forth
								in this Privacy Policy.
Non-Personal Information.
Because your Non-Personal
							Information does not personally identify you, we and our third
							party service providers may use such information for any purpose.
							For example, we may work with third parties for the purpose of
							advertisement delivery on the Sites, including online behavioral
							advertising (""OBA"") and multi-site advertising. The Non-Personal
							Information collected about your visits to the Sites may be used
							by third parties in order to provide advertisements about goods
							and services of interest to you. These third parties may also set
							cookies or web beacons to assist with advertisement delivery
							services.
In addition, we reserve the right to share your
							Non-Personal Information with our affiliates and with other third
							parties, for any purpose. In some instances, we and our third
							party service providers may combine Non-Personal Information with
							Personal Information. If we do combine any Non-Personal
							Information with Personal Information, the combined information
							will be treated by us as Personal Information hereunder (as long
							as it is so combined).
3.Other Important Notices Regarding Our Privacy Practices.
Forums and Profiles.
We and our third party service
							providers may make available through the Sites certain services
							(for example, message boards, reviews, chat functionality, ""profile pages""
							and blogs) to which you may be able to post information and
							materials. Please note that any information you provide in
							connection with such services may become public, and may be
							available to visitors to the Sites and to the general public,
							including without limitation the ratings and reviews that
							accompany many restaurant listings and the comments section of
							our blog posts. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution
							when deciding to disclose your Personal Information, and/or any
							other information and/or materials, on the Sites. NEITHER WE, NOR
							ANY OF OUR THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, NOR ANY OTHER PERSON OR
							ENTITY DULY AUTHORIZED BY US AND/OR BY OUR THIRD PARTY SERVICE
							PROVIDERS, IS OR SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY USE BY ANY
							UNAUTHORIZED PERSON OR ENTITY OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU
							DISCLOSE THROUGH THE SITES.
Third Party Sites.
Except as expressly set forth herein,
							this Privacy Policy does not address, and neither we nor our
							third party service providers are responsible for, the privacy,
							information or other practices of other websites and/or any third
							parties, including without limitation any of our affiliates
							and/or any third party operating any site to which the Sites
							contains a link. The inclusion of a link to a third party website
							on the Sites does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us
							or by our affiliates. Please note that your access and/or use of
							any third party websites, including by providing any information,
							materials and/or other content to such sites, is entirely at your
							own risk.
Security.
We and our third party service providers use
							reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures
							to protect Personal Information under our control. However, no
							data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be
							guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please do not send us credit card
							information and/or other sensitive information through email. If
							you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is not
							secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account
							you might have with us has been compromised), you must
							immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in
							accordance with the ""Contacting Us"" section below.
Unsubscribe.
If you do not wish to receive
							marketing-related emails or SMS text linked web pages from us, you may unsubscribe from
							receiving them by clicking on the ""unsubscribe"" link at the
							bottom of any of those emails or the web pages linked by URL within the SMS message.
Changing Personal Information.
You may review, correct
							and/or update certain elements of your Personal Information by
							adjusting your preferences in the ""Setting->Update Your Profile"" section of
							cartana.co. We and our third party service providers are not
							responsible for altering Personal Information from the databases
							and/or other records of third parties with whom we and our third
							party service providers have shared your Personal Information.
Retention Period.
We and our third party service providers
							will retain Personal Information for the period reasonably
							necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy
							Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted
							by law.
Note Regarding the Use of the Site by Children.
Under no
							circumstances are the Sites directed to and/or intended for use
							by individuals under the age of thirteen (13). Such individuals
							are prohibited from using the Sites and should not provide
							Personal Information through the Sites.
Disclaimer.
If you choose to access the Sites, you do so
							at your own risk, and are responsible for complying with all

About Us Amazing Chinese Restaurant
Dim Sum Factory proudly serves the traditional cuisine of Shanghai China. We’re known for Shanghai & Cantonese style dim sum such as our savory soup dumplings, fried buns, Shumai and scallion pancakes, but our entrees are also a fan favorite. We opened Dim Sum Factory with the intention of sharing the unmistakable flavors of Jiangzhe (East of China) and Shanghai across the globe while honoring the legacy of our ancient recipes.
In Fall 2020 we greatly expanded and renovated our restaurant in effort to provide a comfortable dining experience and allow for quick & contactless takeout and delivery. We invite you to join us in our dining room or bring our flavors home for a meal around the TV with friends. Either way, we believe you’ll fall in love with the flavors of Shanghai and the service of Dim Sum Factory.

Testimonial

Andrew Wong
I’ve visited China numerous times and this Shanghai-styled dim sum is as close as you get. Very authentic with each dim sum piece a jewel in itself.
–
Wendy Lai
We loved the seafood fried rice, chicken skewers, and the scallion pancakes. All and all we gave this 5 stars.
–
Danny Quick
With very low expectations we went there for our dinner. The restaurant is spacious, good lighting and ample seating.

The dim sum at this restaurant was delicious! If you like good quality dim sum, then you can look no further.

Q:
Can I bring alcohol?
A:
I believe they are BYOB. When I was there people had bottles of wine on their tables. 
Call before you go to verify. They may have been a party since they were all sitting at the long tables together

Q:
Are there tables suitable for 6 people?
A:
Yes. This place is actually more ideal for groups than singles or a couple. The tables are like those long, banquet hall style tables. So it's very ideal for a group

About the Business
Bao Nine is an Asian fusion restaurant in Philadelphia inspired by the irresistible Taipei street-style Gua Bao: tender, delicious bao buns.

FAQs
See more FAQs
How do I transfer to another registrar such as GoDaddy?
Yes, you can transfer your domain to any registrar or hosting company once you have purchased it. Since domain transfers are a manual process, it can take up to 5 days to transfer the domain.
Domains purchased with payment plans are not eligible to transfer until all payments have been made. Please remember that our 30-day money back guarantee is void once a domain has been transferred.
For transfer instructions to GoDaddy, please

.
How do I get the domain after the purchase?
Once you purchase the domain we will push it into an account for you at our registrar, NameBright.com, we will then send you an email with your NameBright username and password. In most cases access to the domain will be available within one to two hours of purchase, however access to domains purchased after business hours will be available within the next business day.
What comes with the domain name?
Nothing else is included with the purchase of the domain name. Our registrar NameBright.com does offer email packages for a yearly fee, however you will need to find hosting and web design services on your own.
Do you offer payment plans?
Yes we offer payment plans for up to 12 months.
See details
.
How do I keep my personal information private?
If you wish the domain ownership information to be private, add WhoIs Privacy Protection to your domain. This hides your personal information from the general public.
To add privacy protection to your domain, do so within your registrar account. NameBright offers WhoIs Privacy Protection for free for the first year, and then for a small fee for subsequent years.
Whois information is not updated immediately. It typically takes several hours for Whois data to update, and different registrars are faster than others. Usually your Whois information will be fully updated within two days.

I admire this spot! They provide great dishes, their menu is large, The chief cook in that spot is very experienced, I enjoy very much trying all their dishes. The food is always fresh, the attitude towards the visitors  is agreeable. I often eat in this restaurant and I not even once was unhappy. Highly recommended.

MAKE YOUR MEAL
BY FOLLOWING
THESE 5 TIPS
ENJOYABLE
Use metal tongs provided to move raw meat on the grill.
1
Use your chopsticks to remove cooked meat
from the grill.
Do not load the grill up with too many meats
2
at the same time. This increases the risk of fire.
Meats that are higher in fat content
3
(especially Toro Beef and Pork) should be cooked
around the edges of the grill.
Table sauces go in your sauce tray and not on the grill.
While meat is cooking on the grill, do not add any table
4
sauces on it. For best flavor, add the sauces when your
meats are cooked and on your plate!
Questions about how to best grill your meat

We choose all of our wines with care and an emphasis on offering great value - wines that over-deliver and complement our food.
Vintages change and sometimes we don't know until the wines arrive at our door. We make every effort to keep our wine list up-to-date.
Unfortunately, many of our purveyors continue to experience supply chain challenges. We apologize in advance if we do not have your first choice.
We have a changing selection of craft cocktails. Below are just a few of our favorites.
SOUTH's Signature Cocktails
Originals and twists on the classics.
The SOUTH Sazerac
Our twist on the classic made with Dad's Hat Pennsylvania Rye Whiskey, Martell Cognac and a spritz of Absinthe. Served chilled, up, with a twist of lemon. The original Sazerac was crowned the official cocktail of New Orleans in 2008.

Happy Hour
London’s culinary revolution makes landfall stateside care of The Dandelion, a sophisticated homage to the British pub serving updated seasonal takes on U.K. cuisine.
Just steps from Philadelphia’s bustling Rittenhouse Square, this inviting bilevel restaurant features a whirlwind of idiosyncratic seating areas, bars, hallways, rooms and nooks, each impeccably fashioned to carry its own personality. Whether you’re relaxing with a rare cask ale by the brick fireplace, taking afternoon tea in the Victorian-style dining room or enjoying our famous burger in the ruff-and-tumble “Dog Room,” there’s space for everyone. The menu, featuring beloved classics like Welsh rarebit, fish and chips, shepherd’s pie and a U.K. cheese board, also features plenty of unexpected surprises. Made-from-scratch puddings and hearty family-style roasts served every Sunday round out one of Philly’s most tantalizing dining destinations.

That tradition lives on at our new brewery and taproom at 500 Spring Garden Street.

IT’S A GOOD DAY TO BE SWAYED
about the wayward
The Wayward is inspired by the rebellious spirit of Stephen Girard and his journey from Bordeaux to Philly. We are a place where weary travelers and curious locals alike can come together over good food and easy conversation. So wander over and stay for a bit. We’ll be waiting with a strong drink in hand.
menu
Our menu is focused on American classic and our food, drinks and extensive gin selections are some of the best in the city. Please note, the menu is subject to change and is frequently updated to reflect the seasonality of ingredients.

History
It is rumored that the Valley Green Inn was established in 1683.
Well, almost… The Valley Green Inn is built on land that was part of a several hundred acre tract purchased from William Penn in 1685. It had absentee owners in England and Ireland until 1791 when it was bought by the Livezey family who ran a large grist mill downstream.
In about the year 1850, Thomas Livezey rented to Edward Rinker about three acres of land on the Wissahickon Creek below and adjoining the stone arch bridge. He was to build a house and had the privilege of having boats on the stream to accommodate picnics. He paid two years rent January 2, 1852 of $50.
Rinker may have first built a smaller dwelling and then soon after built a larger building he named the Valley Green Hotel. There followed a succession of innkeepers throughout the nineteenth century, all who no doubt served catfish, waffles, and chicken dinners; the popular fare of other Wissahickon establishments.
The Valley Green Hotel was built during 1850-51 at the same time as the Wissahickon Turnpike (Lincoln Drive) was being completed. The turnpike brought recreational visitors into the Valley by carriage and horseback to view the lovely scenery.
In 1868, the newly created Fairmount Park Commission appropriated the creek and its banks, including the turnpike, and they improved the condition of the road and removed the toll gates. The Livezeys then sold the hotel to the Park in 1873.
In 1899, the chief engineer of Fairmount Park recommended the building be demolished; it was in disrepair and the Park did not have the funds to renovate. Fortunately the building was saved by a local committee, headed by Charles W. Henry, which raised $1228 for the restoration.
In 1901, a committee of women, arranged by Lydia T. Morris, was given permission by the Park to manage the newly restored Valley Green Hotel. They served light refreshments and afternoon tea to riders, pedestrians and wintertime skaters. These women managed the popular Valley Green Hotel in this manner for many years. At this time, the restaurant became officially known as the Valley Green Inn.
In the mid-1930’s, the Friends of the Wissahickon, a large group dedicated to the preservation of the Valley, became interested in the Inn. Restorations were again necessary, and, under the leadership of the Friends and Park Commissioner, Samuel Fleisher, new foundations, a new roof and timbers were added. The Inn was re-dedicated at a ceremonial dinner in 1937. The Inn has been under the joint care of the friends of the Wissahickon and the Park Commission ever since yet remains a privately run business.
Throughout the years, the Inn has been the focus of numerous paintings, postcards and writings, as well as the setting for many special occasions. T.A. Daily wrote in 1922 that, “The charm of Valley Green varies not only with the seasons, but with the day of the week and the hour of the day.”

About the Business
Fattoush is a new restaurant that has opened on Lancaster avenue in Malvern in the location previously occupied by the King Street Grill and right near Margaret Kuo's. It's run by Roger of Roger's Bistro in West Chester who consistently earns 5 star tripadvisor reviews for not only the incredible quality of his cooking but also for his warmth and hospitality!

Right now the restaurant is open for dinner in a soft opening as Roger ""tweaks"" the menu. Presently there are many classic Mediterranean dishes including hummus, falafel, baba ganoush, kibbe, lamb and chicken.

The restaurant space is light and airy will a nice palette of colors on the walls, ceilings and floors. During this soft opening they are continuing to refine and adjust the ambiance with music, additional wall coverings and other esthetic touches. If you want to get your mediterranean/middle eastern food fix right now, don't hesitate to dine at Fattoush.

Dining at Fattoush is like eating a delicious home cooked meal prepared by a close relative who happens to live in another country and have expertise with that cuisine!

Q:
Is the meat halal? thanks
A:
Yes, the meat is halal. We asked the owner. Some restaurants do not advertise if they are halal because it's off putting to some people. Sad reality of the climate we live in. That's why you should always call to ask and not assume.

Rory G:
The food is always freshly made and flavorful. Their Gyros are awesome and fresh with authentic Greek flavors. Today I tried the #2 Combination platter which features a meat kabob, sliced lamb and beef combo as would be in a Gyro, rice and Turlu which is a Greek veggie combination and delicious.

Darshan S:
Best Greek restaurant in Philly! The food is awesome, you can taste the freshness or the ingredients - no wonder this place has been around for almost 5 decades. The staff is very friendly and the service is amazing to top off the delicious food and the wide spread.

Suzy A:
This is the best Greek restaurant EVER! I am from NYC and I was impressed with the places in Astoria until I came here. Decor is authentic, great atmosphere, excellent service. All the dishes I have tried on the menu are perfection. I want to try everything. So far, I have had the grilled pork chop and braised lamb. Both so amazing.

Ryan L:
Had a great lunch here today, getting the grilled chicken breast salad.  The amount of chicken was plentiful, and the flavor is incredible!  The feta and chick peas was also nice.  I'd definitely come back here to try some of their other meats on the spit.  Thank you!

Delicious food! Ordered the baklava and a pita sandwich. Got it for take-out, and it was fresh as could be upon delivery
Tifani Kirchem
Atmosphere and customer service was great.
Greek and Lamb Gyros were delicious (we ordered the fries on the side rather than in it). A different kind of tatziki than I've had, it had a little spice to it, but it was delicious. The pita was perfectly crisped on the outside. The gyros were loaded with meat was so much I

had to take some off to be able to bite it, but they were delicious. Surprisingly, the fries were tasty too. Not just a plain french fry.

The baklava was pretty good. Not too sweet and perfectly cooked.

The food was tasty and filling and the shop itself is bright and inviting. There is a small dining area in the back that looks

great too. I'll be back to try a few more menu items for sure.

Iâm not from the area but was staying nearby for an event and decided to give this place a try. Was greeted by good service from the guy at the counter and we dined in. Food came out quick and was delicious. Guy who served us even brought extra free fries which was very nice of him. I had a delicious chicken gyro.

Overall would recommend. Great experience

Important Information About Our Menu
Menu pricing varies by location – to view location-specific menus, visit our

*These items may be served raw or undercooked. Consuming raw or undercooked meats, poultry, seafood, shellfish, or eggs may increase your risk of foodborne illness, especially if you have certain medical conditions.
Please be aware that our restaurants use gluten and ingredients that contain all the major FDA allergens (peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, fish, shellfish, milk, sesame, soy and wheat).
Our restaurants have shared cooking and preparation areas and the possibility exists for food items to come into contact with other food products. Due to these circumstances, we are unable to guarantee that any menu item can be completely free of allergens. In addition, while effort is made to keep our product information current and as complete as possible, it is possible that ingredient changes and substitutions may occur due to differences in regional suppliers, recipe revisions, preparation techniques, and/or the season of the year.
Before placing your order, please inform your server if someone in your party has a food allergy or a special dietary need and we will do our best to make accommodations.

Q:
I assume all the cheese is vegan. Is that correct? Also, what is the brand of fake meat? Is it impossible? Beyond?
A:
Everything here is vegan. I’m not sure what the fake meat is. I don’t buy that.

Q:
Would this be an okay place to come and work for a few hours on a weekday afternoon?
A:
No, seating is limited and this place gets packed even on weekdays. Once you're done your food you're suppose to get up so other people can sit down and enjoy! :)

20 Years of Street Art Culture
From the first tag to the latest wheat paste, upstairs at TMom’s has been home to a rich history of local & international street art. This is an ever changing gallery: an un-curated & spontaneous outpouring of creativity by local & traveling artists and the countless visitors who leave their unique mark here nightly.
LEARN MORE
Two Brothers & 5000 Umbrellas
The birth of the upstairs as a vibrant art space is in part tied to a 1999 exhibition by brothers Noah & Nathan Rice. That year the Brothers Rice brought their umbrella wheat pastes we’d been admiring around South Street to Mom’s. All 5000 of them.

About the Business
Harvest Seasonal Grill features a local, farm to table menu with many items that are below 500 calories in an upscale casual atmosphere. Every three months, we update our menu to celebrate the new flavors that accompany the change in seasons. We also offer 50+ wines by the glass, as well as a growing selection of local and organic beers.

At Harvest, we believe that where your food comes from is as important as what you eat, which is why we champion the ideology of 'know your farmer, know your food'. We work with over 75 local farmers to source the freshest and highest quality products available. Our mission of sustainability and green living is carried through every facet of what we do, from our menu to our decor, and even the cleaning products that we use are eco-friendly.

Fine Dining, Redefined
For over two decades, Lacroix has been a pillar of Philadelphia's fine dining scene, where technique, creativity, and hospitality come together above historic Rittenhouse Square. Now, we're embracing a new era. One that keeps the spirit of fine dining but loosens the tie. Expect recognizable dishes with a fresh perspective, an atmosphere that puts you at ease, and a team that knows how to make any night feel like the right one to be out. Whether you're celebrating or just making the most of a random Tuesday, we're here to make it special - no occasion required.

legacy meets modern flavor
Decadent yet approachable, Lacroix invites you to relax and indulge in the finer things. Our menu is a love letter to the French bistro: familiar flavors, layered with technique, and always evolving with the season. Think buttery omelettes crowned with a vin jaune sabayon, house-made Parisian gnocchi with mushroom glace, or a rich, melt-in-your-mouth bone marrow burger. Our raw bar, seasonal vegetables, and shareable small plates make every meal feel both refined and effortlessly enjoyable.
View our Menus
Cocktails Rooted in Nature & Story
Created with James Beard Award-winning mixologist Danny Childs, our cocktail program is all about bold flavors and fresh twists. Think local botanicals, foraged ingredients, and a dash of Philly's history in every glass. Whether it's a reimagined Martini or our take on the historic tipple Fish House Punch, each drink brings something unexpected. We're here to surprise you with every sip, keeping things fresh, local, and always intriguing.
