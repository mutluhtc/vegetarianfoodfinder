About Us
Mexican Food is not about just rice and beans. Mexican Food is about tradition, the tradition of bringing families together after a long day of work and winding down to a meal that while nutritious, will also be delicious.
This is something that the Bravo family has know all of their life. See, the Bravo family come from Jalisco Mexico, from a town called Altamira. The towns name roughly translate in English to Highland. This is where hard work and outrageously delicious food was engraved into their skin.
With years and years of experience of cooking the perfect, most authentic meals, the Bravo family wanted to share it with Indiana. That is why they are here, and that is what you will get, An authentically delicious Mexican meal along with the best drinks in Indiana.
Come visit us at Lindo Mexico in Greenwood and Lafayette and let us treat you the only way we have treated every customer for the past 2 decades, like you are part of the family. Because when you are here, ""Nuestra casa, es SU casa""
