Recognizing
""Our Family""
who have been with us for 10, 20, 25, and 30 years!
Thank You!
For over 30 years, Carrabba’s has been Houston’s true neighborhood restaurant. Family owned and operated, The Original Carrabba’s on Kirby Drive opened on Dec. 26, 1986, with $500 in the cash register (a loan from Mr. C, Johnny’s dad), 94 seats, seven barstools, and a menu whose most expensive item was a $9.95 T-bone steak and a glass of the best wine came in at a whopping $2.25.
After the initial success of the restaurant – “lightning in a bottle,” Johnny has called it – a second location opened at Voss Road and Woodway Drive. Eventually, the original Carrabba’s outgrew its 3,000 square feet and moved to a newer, larger space.  What began with a relatively simple concept – a casual Italian restaurant that featured a wood-burning pizza oven, big bowls of pasta, and an open kitchen – would become the heart of Houston’s dining scene.
But for all the changes Carrabba’s has undergone over the years, some things have remained constant: Our commitment to fantastic food, the warm, inviting, comfortable, family-oriented feeling of our restaurants, mature servers who understand the value of impressing and appreciating our guests, and a staff that has fun and knows our customers by name.
We don’t operate our restaurants based on lessons learned in some fancy cooking school or business book. We operate them based on heart and soul, and a belief that our job at the end of the day is to give our guests an experience they’ll love – and remember. And that’s what we do. Every day.

Potente focuses on sourcing local products whenever possible and uses only the highest quality ingredients. The kitchen is overseen by Executive Chef Danny Trace. Chef Danny and his team shop the local Houston Farmers Markets on select Saturday mornings to choose the fruits and vegetables that he will serve at Potente. The modern Italian menu features all wild-caught seafood selections, USDA steaks and homemade pastas. In November 2020, Potente’s truffle pasta was featured as
“One of the Best Pastas in the Country”
by the Food Network.

The restaurant’s boutique wine list features a vast selection of Italian wines, as well as a section of California’s finest vintners. Should you need a recommendation from our wine list, our Sommelier is available during dinner service to assist. In addition to our special collection of wine, a selection of fine whiskeys, scotches, tequilas, spirits, liquors and craft beers are available.
CHEF TRACE
Executive Chef Danny Trace joined Potente and
Osso & Kristalla
in 2017.

“The most memorable meals for me are of my grandmother and grandfather in the kitchen. My grandmother’s family was from Milan and Naples, Italy and my grandfather was a Cajun from Thibodaux, Louisiana. From étouffée to grand bowls of pasta, the marriage of these traditional dishes and family experiences is the very reason I am a chef.”

Recognizing
""Our Family""
who have been with us for 10, 20, 25, and 30 years!
Thank You!
For over 30 years, Carrabba’s has been Houston’s true neighborhood restaurant. Family owned and operated, The Original Carrabba’s on Kirby Drive opened on Dec. 26, 1986, with $500 in the cash register (a loan from Mr. C, Johnny’s dad), 94 seats, seven barstools, and a menu whose most expensive item was a $9.95 T-bone steak and a glass of the best wine came in at a whopping $2.25.
After the initial success of the restaurant – “lightning in a bottle,” Johnny has called it – a second location opened at Voss Road and Woodway Drive. Eventually, the original Carrabba’s outgrew its 3,000 square feet and moved to a newer, larger space.  What began with a relatively simple concept – a casual Italian restaurant that featured a wood-burning pizza oven, big bowls of pasta, and an open kitchen – would become the heart of Houston’s dining scene.
But for all the changes Carrabba’s has undergone over the years, some things have remained constant: Our commitment to fantastic food, the warm, inviting, comfortable, family-oriented feeling of our restaurants, mature servers who understand the value of impressing and appreciating our guests, and a staff that has fun and knows our customers by name.
We don’t operate our restaurants based on lessons learned in some fancy cooking school or business book. We operate them based on heart and soul, and a belief that our job at the end of the day is to give our guests an experience they’ll love – and remember. And that’s what we do. Every day.

Gluten Friendly Crust
**Our gluten-friendly and cauliflower crusts have a gluten content of less than 20ppm based on information provided by our ingredient suppliers; however, we cannot guarantee that pizzas made with these crusts will be gluten-free as we prepare all of our pizzas in a common kitchen with a risk of gluten exposure. In addition, certain toppings contain gluten. We do not recommend these pizzas for guests with Celiac Disease. Guests with gluten sensitivities should exercise judgment in consuming these pizzas.

Daniele Uditi’s interpretation of the Naples staple is reimagined with consciously sourced toppings which blend the traditional with the unexpected. His signature “slow dough” is meticulously prepared and allowed to ferment for two days. The result is a light, easy-to-digest crust still sturdy enough to pick up with one hand.

About the Business
MONA Fresh Italian Food is a unique concept combining the swiftness of a fast-casual restaurant with the sophistication of upscale surroundings and high-quality food. MONA uses fresh, local products in a warm and cozy environment offered in their natural forms sourced from locally owned farms. 

The five-step menu starts with the base (house made fettuccini, bruschetta, chopped salad), topped with fresh veggies, cheeses and garnishes. Guests can choose to upgrade with multiple protein options and customize their entrées with homemade sauces, dressings and seasonings.   Organic herb gardens of basil and microgreens can be found at the end of the line for customers to cut fresh for added flavor to their newly created dishes.

MONA is a chef-driven, fast-casual restaurant serving the best of Italian cuisine for the value-motivated diner. We set out to be a place guests will want to visit often for our delicious and approachable menu. The atmosphere is inviting and comfortable allowing patrons to feel they are dining in the comforts of their own homes, with the opportunity to interact with our chefs and experience the variety of authentic Italian-inspired recipes.

About the Business
With James Beard-nominated chef and restauranteur Levi Goode at the helm, our fourth Kitchen & Cantina from Goode Company Restaurants showcases the rich foods and traditions we grew up with on both sides of the border. Find us located across from the historic River Oaks Theatre where you'll find an experience inspired by long days on the Gulf, late nights on the ranch, and the colorful creations of our abuela. Try wood-fired redfish on the half shell swaddled in homemade tortillas, made-to-order guacamole, and family-style parrilladas - huge mixed platters of wild game and fresh vegetables, topped with pico de gallo and queso fresco. A few margaritas on our patio and you've found your new casa sweet casa. Top off the experience by wandering over to our agave sanctuary Bar Buena nestled around the corner (coming soon).

BACON WRAPPED BANDERA QUAIL
Start your meal at TRIBUTE with these delectable bites that have an authentic quail hunting guide’s seal of approval. This story begins on a 7800-acre
ranch in La Pryor, Texas. Hotel General Manager Steve Fronterhouse and Executive Chef Neal Cox were invited to the El Mirador ranch towards the end
of quail hunting season, and heard the guide remark that he had eaten so much quail during the season he refused to eat another bite. Thinking about
what they’d brought to cook for the community dinner, Steve asked the guide to give them a chance and eat a bite of quail prepared by Chef Neal.
The guide agreed, and the next night, after eating the Bacon Wrapped Bandera Quail, gave the dish
its highest marks, and later pulled Chef Neal aside to ask for the recipe.

FROM TEXAS PRESENT AND FUTURE
LOUISIANA AND MEXICO OF HOUSTON
Houston was founded by land speculators on August 30th, 1836 at the confluence of
White Oak Bayou and Buffalo Bayou. After briefly serving as the capital of the Republic in the late 1830s,
Houston grew into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century.
For almost four decades now The Houstonian has been humbled to share the name of our beloved city
as we sit along the banks of Buffalo Bayou where it all began.
Over the years, Houston has welcomed those who have traveled across
our southern and eastern borders, bringing diverse cultures and traditions
that have helped shape and evolve our city into what it is today.
Houston, a multicultural town where differences are embraced and celebrated,
is a true melting pot of colorful and creative people.
Whether we’re boiling crawfish, roasting pork, or grilling steaks over an open fire,
Houston absolutely has it all.
Join us as we share our passion for regional cuisine
from our neighbors to the north, south, and east.

Tabasco Tasting Menu
Available for dinner Monday - Saturday from Oct 2 - Nov 1
Caracol’s menus are culinary tours along Mexico’s coasts, shaped by 16 coastal states. To spotlight the diversity of regional flavors, we feauture a monthly tasting menu series, each one dedicated to a different coastal state. This October, we invite you to experience Tabasco!
History & Background
Tabasco, in southeastern Mexico along the Gulf, is a land of rainforests, rivers, and ancient heritage. As the cradle of the Olmec civilization, its history shines through archaeological sites and vibrant traditions. Villahermosa, the capital, bridges modern life with natural beauty, surrounded by wetlands rich in wildlife.
The cuisine reflects its fertile land and waterways: robalo a la tabasqueña, grilled pejelagarto, river shrimp, tamales with chipilín, and the grand zacahuil. Plantains, cacao, corn, and tropical fruits infuse Tabasco’s dishes with flavor and warmth. This menu honors the state’s proud culinary heritage, alive with tradition and festivity.

The stars of the show
“Trompo Tacos” or “Middle East Tacos”
are marinated pork shawarma tacos grilled in a revolving spit and were created by middle eastern immigrants that settled in
Puebla, Mexico
after World War I. The original recipe evolved through time, bringing together the middle eastern seasoning and cooking techniques with the Mexican tortilla and salsas, creating one of
the most iconic Mexican dishes.

Q:
Is the farm animals only in the Channelview location?  So the one on Market Street is only a restaurant?  And I heard there's no A/C, can someone confirm please?
A:
That is correct about the farm. Not 100 % about the a/c @ market I ate outside both times. But my opinion save your money. I've been to #1 location twice and #2 once, and was disappointed every time.

About Us
Don Carlos Mexican Restaurant is one of the best family-owned Mexican Restaurants in Houston & Waco, serving delicious Tex-Mex cuisine since 1986. We love to welcome our new and regular customers to provide great customer service and a tasty experience. In 1986, two Greek brothers, Christos and Gerry Stathatos, had a passion to achieve the American dream one plate of food at a time. From immigrants to businessmen, the two brothers opened their first restaurant in the heart of Houston’s East End to serve the hardworking people of the city. Later expanding to their second location near Hobby Airport in 1994, and their third location in Waco, Texas in 2009, their drive to provide every customer a quality plate of food has not ceased.

View all Reviews
The Houston Chronicle Dining Guide
""The lure of these small packets spans age groups and cultures in a way that's almost primal.""
The Houston Press
: Best Empanada award 2008
""Inside, don't be surprised to see Marcello or his daughter greeting customers new and old like family, welcoming them with warm smiles and lots of friendly conversation.""
Cooks Tour
""I love the fact that the Marini family has never resorted to the icky-sticky commercial fillings that many bakeries use these days. You get a real sense of the fruit from their dessert empanadas, which is all too rare.""

Delhi by way of Houston
The Chef defines her cuisine as a combination of cultures, philosophies and cooking techniques. Sourced from local purveyors and the Gulf waters, our food is inspired by the Awadhi style of cooking – the art of cooking over a slow fire, with the subtle use of spices and herbs to create delicate flavors. Some of the food is also cooked in traditional clay ovens, or tandoors, in the style of the Indian North-West Frontier Province. Our dishes are inventive but authentic to the traditions and style of north Indian cuisine.
Our meats are antibiotic- and hormone-free and come from sustainable sources.
All our chicken and lamb is Halal.

Some of Our Fan Favorites
""Serving delicious food was a way of honoring a guest. Naturally we carried on this legacy of hosting with our family and friends, pleased with the satisfaction of loved ones enjoying the food in each others company. For each family get-together and party, my wife and I gladly cook and cater to the tastes of each member of the gathering, because this is how we express our love. The gift of love and sharing was instilled in us during our formative years in India.

This persistent passion for food and hospitality began in us a desire to make a space available to everyone, an open table, where families can sit and where friendships can begin, all in the presence of a re-imagined and flavorful cuisine that is comprised of both family and traditional recipes.""

Tarka: “The pop and sizzle of spices dancing on hot oil”
OUR ROOTS
Fresh, Healthy Indian Cuisine
We set out with a simple premise. Create a restaurant with
fresh and flavorful Indian food
that is also fast and affordable. Serve it in a casual, modern space with stellar customer service. Make it as convenient as possible, whether you’re enjoying a relaxing meal on our patio with a glass of wine, or grabbing takeout using our online ordering system. And, run it as environmentally friendly as we can.
Our first store opened in Austin in 2009, and from that moment on, our guests have been almost as passionate about Tarka as we are. We had lines out the door, but couldn’t make the food fast enough. Struggling to keep up, we scrambled to redo our menu countless times before we finally found the right balance of curries, kabobs, biryanis, and freshly baked flatbreads. And we paired the food with great drinks like mango lemonade, fresh fruit lassis, and select wine and beer.
Enthusiastically embraced by Austin, Tarka opened its second location a year later and a third shortly after that. We opened our first store outside of Austin in 2014, and now have locations in
Austin
,
San Antonio
,
Round Rock
, and
Houston
, Texas.
At Tarka, we know that sound and smell intimately, from our own kitchens growing up. We have experienced the deliciousness that happens when our moms bring out their spice tiffins, and get their Tarka on. Tarka is committed to making affordable and healthy Indian cuisine and offers a variety of vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free menu items.
Dine-in. Take Out. Delivery via third-party delivery partners.

Great food and service! Veggie lovers will truly admire this place and will make it their new to go weekly spot. The owner Raj is helpful and will recommend what you’re taste buds are craving. The paneer tikk and dahi puri is me and my wife’s favorite.

I have always been waiting for a delicious Indian food truck in North Houston; finally I can say this is one of the best authentic Indian food truck that is located in North Houston. They work very hard to cater everyones' taste buds. I am very impressed with their service, quantity, and quality of the food.

All I can say is WOW. The paneer burger is the best veggie burger I’ve ever had. It’s dangerously good. Highly recommend checking this place out!

The gyutoro nigiri is something that I could eat multiple times every day. This has three of my all time favorite ingredients working together: short ribs, fresh wasabi and sushi rice.

My favorite dish is the hirame usuzukuri. I love this dish because it’s simple, light and refreshing – but most of all delicious.

I highly recommend this place! The food, the atmosphere, and the service is great! Kevin was our waiter and he was the best! He made sure we were well taken care of.
Lisa Duran
Qin Dynasty is just amazing. My friends had Chinese food and I opted for sushi. The food was wonderful. And the prices were really good. Thank you. See you again!
Michelle
One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the Houston area. The food is always fresh, delicious, quick and a great value. Everything on the menu is very good and made to order.
Bille Baty
First time to eat here in many years. Same delicious quality food and attentive service as usual. Hot and Sour soup is best in town. Lunch specials offer incredible choices.
Russell Adams
The place is clean. I ordered Unagi don and it tastes authentic!! I would say I have found my favourite spot for Asian food in Houston! Will definitely visit for the rolls next time!
Jessica Fung
I have been eating at this restaurant for years. I like that they use white meat chicken for dishes and good quality beef for my favorite beef with mushrooms and peppers.

BAO CHICKA BOW WOW
OUR KITCHEN
All natural
Back in the summer of 2012, two high school friends teamed up to answer the question, ""what is the tastiest ingredient we can stuff inside these steamed buns?""
They worked day and night searching for the perfect combination.  Crab and coleslaw?  Banana and Nutella?  How far outside the box could they go?

One recent patron said,
""We had the most wonderful evening in this charming 1920's cottage by the Merlion Lagoon. We went to our first wine tasting dinner - Incredible! The lamb was succulent as was the Kobe beef. The waiters were gracious, fun and most of all extremely knowledgeable. The wine list is superb and they have chosen wines from all over the world. We had lived in Thailand for many years and my husband & I both agree that the food is, by far, one of the best you will ever eat!""

Spicy Levels
At Naam Khao we LOVE SPICY and our levels are the hottest in Houston. However, we realize it is not for everyone. Truth is many Thai people do not eat spicy so that is why almost all of our dishes are individually spiced to your needs.
We use Fresh Thai Chilis or our House Wok Roasted Thai Chili Dust. Menu items are marked with their default spicy level but you can choose the right level for your enjoyment.
Spicy Level
â
None
-
â
Low / Mild
- Just a little bit...
â
Medium
â About same heat level as a fresh jalapeÃ±o
â
Hot
â Most people stop here!
â
Thai Hot
â Very very very spicy, few can eat this!
â
Cry Hot
â Good Luck!
Levels are 0-1-2-3-4-5 but really more like 0-1-2-5-10-50!  Order requested with Hot, Thai Hot and Cry Hot cannot be exchanged or refunded for excessive heat!  If in doubt start with Medium and work your way up.
Please note: Current prices and availability may not be reflected and are subject to change. Final prices can be verified by phone and at time of payment. Thank you for your understanding.

William  H.
Business Owner
Pranee's Thai Cuisine, a small and homey Thai/Laos restaurant, had a humble beginning. It all started with the owner's passion for cooking authentic Southeast Asian dishes, passed down from generations of their family's recipes.

About the Business
Business owner information
Alan O.
Business Owner
We specialize in original authentic Thai homemade cooking that makes us stand out from other restaurants.
Thai food has its unique exotic flavors and veggies for example;
Common flavors in Thai food come from garlic, galangal, coriander/cilantro, lemon grass, shallots, pepper, kaffir lime leaves, shrimp paste, fish sauce, and chilies. Palm sugar, made from the sap of certain Borassus palms, is used to sweeten dishes while lime and tamarind contribute sour notes.

MERCHANTS
Smile provides technology services to Merchants to enable Customers to place Orders, facilitates Orders with Merchants, and processes Payment Transactions on behalf of each Merchant.
Orders and Payment Transactions you make through our Service are transactions between you and the Merchant only, not with Smile or any of our affiliates.  Smile is not the seller of any product or service offered by Merchants and is not a party to any Payment Transaction facilitated through the Service.
You hereby acknowledge and understand that each Merchant is solely responsible and liable for all aspects of its own day-to-day operations and all selling, pricing, packaging, and provision of any products or services offered to its Customers through the Service.  Smile makes no representation or warranty regarding whether a Merchant holds any applicable permit, license, registration, or other credential for its business, whether representations by a Merchant are true and accurate, or whether a Merchant complies with applicable law.  Smile is not responsible for the quality of the products or services provided by Merchants.

When you create an Account, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times.  Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your Account.
You are responsible for safeguarding your login information that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your login information.

Smile hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Application for one Account on a device owned or leased by you, for your personal use.
PLACING ORDERS FOR PRODUCTS
Your Information
If you wish to place an Order for Products available on the Service, you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Order, including, without limitation, your name, email, phone number, credit card number, credit card expiration date, your billing address, and delivery information.
You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit or debit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with your Order; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.  By submitting such information, you grant us the right to provide the information to payment processing third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of your Order.
Order
Smile makes available the Service and, either directly or through a third-party service provider, processes your Payment Transactions for your Orders on behalf of Merchants through the payment networks.  When you make an Order, you authorize Smile, as agent for the Merchant, to submit the charge in the amount of the Order (including any gratuities, fees and taxes) to your Payment Method issuer as well as any credits in connection with chargebacks, reversals, refunds or adjustments.  Smile, as the agent of the Merchant, will assist the Merchant in submitting the Payment Transaction to the payment network and processing the Payment Transaction.  Upon either Smile or a third-party service provider receiving the proceeds of the transaction, your payment obligation to the Merchant will be deemed completed (except in the case of a later chargeback or reversal).
You must provide a valid Payment Method to pay for your Order made through any of the Service.  You authorize Smile to confirm your Payment Method is in good standing with the issuing financial institution.  You agree that Smile, on behalf of the Merchant, may resubmit a Payment Transaction for processing to a payment network in the event a prior Payment Transaction was declined or returned.
If you choose to store Payment Method information with Smile via the Service for your convenience and use in future transactions, you agree that Smile may receive up-to-date information on your Payment Method information (such as card number or expiration date) through services available from the card networks and may update your Payment Method credentials stored with Smile (if you choose to store your Payment Method credentials) from time to time.
We may establish limitations concerning use of the Service, including without limitation, individual or aggregate transaction limits on the dollar amount or number of Payment Transactions you may make within certain time periods.  We may decline to process any Payment Transaction without any notice to you.  We may delay processing of or hold or cancel processing of any Payment Transaction upon the direction of the Merchant or if we believe, in our sole discretion, that the transaction is invalid, suspicious, involves misconduct or fraud, or otherwise violates applicable law and rules, these Terms and Conditions, or any other policies. Payments made through the Service are also subject to the terms of your agreement with your Payment Method issuer.  You are solely responsible for any charges or fees that may be imposed by your Payment Method issuer as a result of using the Service.
Order Changes, Cancellation, and Refunds
Merchants each set their own cancellation and refund policies.  Once an Order has been made through the Service, you will need to contact the Merchant directly to inquire if you can make a change to or cancel the Order or whether you may receive a refund.
You authorize Smile to communicate with the Merchant regarding the change or cancellation of your Order.  Reimbursement will be made upon confirmation by Smile that the change or cancellation of your Order can be made.  We will use the same means of payment as you used for the Order.
For questions or customer service regarding an Order or the product or service provided by a Merchant, please contact the Merchant directly.  Smile is not responsible for any Merchant product or service issues or content errors or inaccuracies related to a Merchant’s website, menu, or other materials.
Smile reserves the right to refuse or cancel your Order at any time for certain reasons, including the following:
There is an error in your Order.
Fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.
Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies
Merchants may update their Products, including their prices, from time to time.  The Products available on our Service may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable, and we may experience delays in updating information regarding the Products on the Service and other websites.
Smile cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information of the Products, including their prices, images, specifications and availability, and Merchants’ services.  We reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions on the Service at any time without prior notice.
Payments
All Products purchased are subject to a one-time payment.  Payment can be made through various payment methods we have available, such as Visa and MasterCard.
Payment cards (credit cards or debit cards) are subject to validation checks and authorization by your card issuer.  If we do not receive the required authorization, we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery of your Order.
Shipping and Delivery
Product shipping, delivery, and preparation timelines are estimated by each Merchant.  Merchants and their shipping or delivery service providers, where applicable, are responsible for ensuring that appropriate insurance policies are in place for the shipping and delivery of the Products to Customers.  Smile will not be responsible for any damage caused to Products during shipping or delivery or any loss or damage caused in connection with the supply of Products.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The Service and its original contents (excluding contents provided by you or other users), features and functionality (including derivative works, modifications, and additions thereto) are and will remain the exclusive property of Smile and its licensors.  The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other applicable laws.
Our intellectual property, including copyright and trademark, may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of Smile.
YOUR FEEDBACK TO US
You assign all rights, title and interest in any Feedback you provide Smile.  If for any reason such assignment is ineffective, you agree to grant Smile a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free, worldwide right and license to use, reproduce, disclose, sub-license, distribute, modify and exploit such Feedback without restriction.

You further acknowledge and agree that Smile shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such websites or services.  We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party websites or services that you visit.
TERMINATION
We may limit, suspend, or terminate your Account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation, if you breach these Terms and Conditions.  Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately.  If you wish to terminate your Account, you may simply discontinue using the Service or send an email to
[email protected]
requesting to terminate your Account.
Termination of your Account does not relieve you of the obligation to pay for any Orders made as well as related fees and charges already incurred.  In the event of closure of your Account, we will not provide any refunds for amounts previously paid through the Service.
In certain cases, we may not allow you to close your Account, including but not limited to:
to evade an investigation;
you have open or pending Orders or Payment Transactions; or
if you owe money to Smile or a Merchant due to your use of the Service.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of Smile and any of its suppliers under any provision of these Terms and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you through the Service.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Smile or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, or business interruption, arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software, and/or third-party hardware used with the Service or otherwise in connection with any provision of these Terms), even if Smile or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability for certain kinds of damages, so some of these limitations may not apply to you.  In such a case, Smile's liability will be limited to the minimum amount enforceable under applicable law.
“AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” DISCLAIMER
The Service is provided to you “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” and with all faults and defects, if any, without warranty of any kind.  To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, Smile, on its own behalf and on behalf of its respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice.  Without limitation to the foregoing, Smile provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.  Without limiting the foregoing, neither Smile nor any of Smile's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of Smile are free of malware or other harmful components.
Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is done at your own discretion and risk and you are solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or device or loss of data that results from the download of any such material.  No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from Smile or a third party through or from the Service will create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some of the above exclusions or limitations may not apply to you.  In such a case, the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the minimum extent required by law.
FORCE MAJEURE
Smile will not be liable for any failure or delay resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to governmental action or acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, pandemic, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, and Internet disturbances.
GOVERNING LAW
The laws of the State of Washington govern these Terms and your use of the Service without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
SEVERABILITY AND WAIVER
Severability
If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
Waiver
Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
TRANSLATION INTERPRETATION
These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if we have made them available to you on our Service.  You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.

Secrets from the Kitchen
If you are dining at Nobu for the first time, the chef recommends trying 3 or more of the menu's ""Eight Highlights."" The best way to enjoy this experience is to start with 2 or 3 cold dishes; then move on to 2 or 3 hot ones. Finally, end with some sushi and dessert. All of these dishes are shared family style.
Here are some of the recommendations:
As a palate opener:
Yellowtail Jalapeno
Delicately sliced yellowtail sashimi with touches of garlic puree, adorned with jalapeno slices then crowned with cilantro and served with Japanese citrus soy sauce; 6 pieces in one order. The cilantro elevates every bite, enhancing the flavor.
For Salad:
Sashimi Salad Matsuhisa Dressing
7 pieces of rare grilled tuna sashimi salad sprinkled with black pepper on a a bed of field greens and served with Nobu Matsuhisa signature onion soy dressing.
For Hot Dishes:
Rock Shrimp Tempura Creamy Spicy
Handful of battered shrimp ""Tempura-ed"" tossed with creamy spicy sauce, flavored with yuzu juice and pieces of shiitake mushrooms,  served over a bed of greens drizzled with yuzu dressing. Best enjoyed together with the greens.
Black Cod Miso
Filet of black cod marinated in Den miso sauce for a few days then baked in oven and finished with a salamander broil.

About the Business
Agnes and Sherman is a modern Asian American diner all about comfort food in a modern cozy setting. Located in the Heights neighborhood of Houston, you can expect scallion waffles, a Chinese BBQ club sandwich, crab rangoon, and more delights. To go with your meal, enjoy Asian American cocktails, zero proof drinks, a playfully classic wine list, and desserts that are not too sweet. 

The team is led by Chef Nick Wong and Managing Partner Lisa Lee, who believe in creating a culture of belonging and community through food. Walk-ins, kids, solo diners, large groups, and service animals are welcome, and parking is plentiful in the neighborhood. Reservations can be made through OpenTable. We hope to see you soon!

Chef Taylor Chung's story
Taylor and his wife, along with two young daughters left Vietnam in the middle of the night on a fisherman's boat, in search of freedom. They left behind their youngest daughter, who was only 11 months old and severely sick with her grandmother. After being chased while dodging pirate ships, throwing the deceased overboard, and bailing water out from the leaks under the boat, they hit the sandy beaches of Phillipines after several days out at sea. They looked up into the clear blue skies and just gave thanks to whomever was watching out for them. That whomever was God, who they later received as their personal Saviour while stationed at the refugee camp. After some time at 2 different refugee camps, they were sponsored by an old friend to Oklahoma. Four months later, they were able to save enough money from lawn mowing jobs to buy a used car. Taylor drove his family up to Ames, Iowa, where they met up with some friends who were on the same boat. Ames became their home for the next 30 years. Eleven years after his departure from Vietnam, their youngest daughter reunited with them in Ames. Fast forward, all their children grew up and became successful in their post college careers, and Taylor and his wife became empty nesters. Taylor has always had a passion for cooking, as he has cooked for all the Vietnamese Christian church conferences and special events. So they decided to pick up and move south to warmer Texas, to get away from the cold winters with the hope and dream of opening their own little restaurant to share their favorite meals. Hence, after one year of exploring Houston and making it their new home, Fu Manchung was born.
As of 9/1/2023, new ownership will take over as Chef Taylor retires after six years at the kitchen helm here. We would sincerely like to thank all that have passed through and for your local small business support over the years. The new owners, are also a small family with the same dream we had years ago of owning a small family ran restaurant. We leave the original stories of the owners here so that you can understand how Fu Manchung came to life.
Lets welcome the new owners, with a grace filled heart and continue to support family local businesses all around. The name and menu will stay intact for the most part, and we wish y'all many blessings in this life's journey.
Love,
Chef Taylor & Paul
Paul's story
Born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa, Paul always dreamed of doing many things in life. He graduated from the University of Iowa with a B.S. degree in Management Information Systems and worked for 10 years at a life insurance company doing mainframe programming, developing databases, and wrapped up his corporate career as an Information Systems Resource Manager. One day he decided to leave and pursue wedding photography. Not knowing a thing about cameras or wedding portraits, he shadowed Taylor for a year, who was his mentor, and eventually would soon become his father in-law. It was through this chapter that he was able to express his art and creativity through documenting and capturing life's moments. Once he accomplished this challenge, it was time to move on to another challenge of running his own restaurant some day as he loves to eat, who doesn't? This is where the current chapter is being written and taking on a new path for the next few years. Paul knew Taylor had a passion for cooking, from endless family gatherings to many church conference events, so Paul asked him if he'd like to partner up. They both packed up and moved south to Texas and will be bringing their family favorite dishes to share with this community. We have never ran or owned a restaurant before, so you are now a part of this new chapter and journey ahead with us. We are grateful and thankful to each of you and your support! Share a smile today. Blessings.

Can’t afford a vacation to the isles? This tropical destination is one hell of a consolation prize. Sip cheekily named cocktails like the Resting Beach Face, a mix of jalapeno-infused tequila, orange, lime, cassis, and overproof rum, and soak up all those umbrella drinks with tater tots drenched in spicy Sichuan pepper sauce.
Houston’s 14 Best New Cocktail Bars.
Jan 20
Located in the heart of Montrose on Richmond Avenue, folks will find classic tiki drinks aplenty as well as many new concoctions that pair tropical fruits with lighter spirits.
Opened in 2019 by husband and wife team Martin and Sara Stayer of Nobie’s Restaurant fame, this tropical beach outpost in Montrose has been churning out innovative cocktails from award-winning bar director Sarah Troxell and amazing bar bites from chef de cuisine Ben Ruiz since flinging open their doors to the tiki-loving masses.
Say aloha and stay awhile while enjoying low-ABV libations including the unforgettable Vamos a la Playa which comes served up with mezcal, Mexican rum, pineapple shrub, and lime; or the unique and savory Sandy Banana that’s made with rye whiskey, peanut, banana, and citrus; or the namesake Toasted Coconut which comes frozen with aged rum, toasted coconut, and citrus.
Don’t forget about the food, though. If you work up an appetite sipping the night away, try bites like coconut shrimp skewers, mapo tofu tater tots, Thai crispy rice and napa salad, or masa dumplings with salsa verde and a fried egg.
Enjoy tiki-inspired food & cocktails at The Toasted Coconut in Montrose
. dec 19
The Sandy Banana neither loses the peanut nor goes overboard on the Elvis sandwich kick. The peanut has the sharpness you’d expect in a Thai curry sauce, while the banana smooths out the back end. Rye is a nice spirit for the Sandy Banana, as it keeps the drink’s edges even as they fade, making it a tropical treat that never tastes like dessert.
Nailing the laid-back rum bar that also wants to showcase the thrill of a mixologist’s skillset is hard to do. Do customers want to simply relax out in the palapa, or would they rather belly up to the bar and ask questions about hard-to-find Jamaican liquor? The Toasted Coconut proves both can be done in one place, and best yet, the weather is perfect for it.

The menu is full of shareable plates such as
Jerk Chicharones
,
Sichuan Pork dumplings
and varieties of
“Skewerz“
, such as
Thai Beef Tenderloin
or our personal favorite,
Reverse Pastor
: al pastor-style marinated chunks of pineapple wrapped in bacon. Larger plates include a
Whole Fish with Mala Sauce
,
Baja-Style Mussels
with guajillo chili and either a half or whole order of
Grandma’s Hot Chicken
. “Thailand, Vietnam—basically if it touches the 20th parallel, we’ll work it into the kitchen,” said Stayer.
Troxell’s cocktail menu is split into three categories
—Refreshing & Slam-able, Tropical & Bright
and
Big N’ Boozy
— and includes classic cocktails as well as remixed versions and plenty of original creations. The
Vamos A La Playa
combines Del Maguey Vida mezcal, Uruapan Charanda blended rum, pineapple shrub and lime juice (and went down entirely too easily on a warm summer evening).
The Seaward
will grab your attention from across the restaurant. It’s a mix of Rhum J.M. blanc, coconut water, lime juice, mint and falernum (a Caribbean liqueur) served in a coconut.
Music is key to the vibe, and audiophiles will be happy to hear that the vintage speakers and large vinyl collection for which Nobie’s is known have made their way to Toasted Coconut as well. Expect to hear a fun mix of Exotica Tiki music with plenty of reggae and, of course, Phish.
First Bite: Toasted Coconut Melds Vibrant Tiki Style With a Full Menu.
Sept 19
The menu consists of mostly sharable plates such as the Not so Queso (a peanut dip served with roti), skewers (leg of lamb and Thai beef are both particularly good), and dumplings that have thin skins with savory, satisfying fillings of either Sichuan pork or butter chicken. Sweet and spicy fried chicken will satisfy those with larger appetites.
Troxell’s cocktails are lighter, more refreshing takes on classic tiki drinks; none of them are as overwhelmingly boozy as at a dedicated tiki temple like Lei Low. Start with the Low Tide, a spin on the classic Mai Tai, or the Seaward, which is served in a coconut.
On the bar-restaurant spectrum, full service makes it more of a restaurant than a place like Better Luck Tomorrow, but the snacky menu makes it more of a bar than La Lucha. It’s hard to imagine coming here just for the food, but very easy to think about spending a day sipping cocktails under the palapa.

— the team behind the acclaimed

Ben Ruiz
offers dishes such as
Eggplant in Vadouvan curry

(which can easily feed 2 people) and the
Baja Style Mussels

On the cocktail side, Troxell is debuting brand-new drinks such as the exquisitely boozy

with reposado tequila, manzanilla sherry, apricot and bitters, and
The Seaward
with Rhum J.M. blanc, coconut water, lime, mint and falernum.
The Hit List: New Houston Restaurants to Visit in September 2019
.
The Toasted Coconut, a bar and restaurant drawing on tiki and tropical inspirations, opened Sept. 5 at 1617 Richmond Ave., Houston. Owned by husband and wife Chef Martin Stayer and Sara Stayer of Nobie’s Restaurant, Toasted Coconut offers a menu that includes shareable plates and larger dishes, in addition to a full bar offering 17 custom cocktails, craft beer and more.

The restaurant
shared
on Instagram yesterday: “It’s official!
@gettoastedhtx
IS NOW OPEN at 4PM everyday except Tuesdays!!!” The tiki bar is serving up cocktails with ingredients like rum and coconut water along with wine and beer, and there’s plenty to eat here too. The Toasted Coconut’s menu is focused on food from the 20th parallel north, which lends itself to crispy Thai rice, dumplings, and skewers.
It’s Tiki Time at the Toasted Coconut, Now Open at Richmond Avenue.
Sept 19
The Toasted Coconut is in the space of the former Maria Selma, and the Stayers kept the palapa that defined that Mexican spot. There’s a patio with a waterfall, plus a neighboring “adult sandbox” called Cinnamon Cove.
But we’re not just talking about a bar here—the Toasted Coconut is a full restaurant with a kitchen run by Ben Ruiz, who spent the last eight years in Chicago. He has come south to serve as chef de cuisine at the Toasted Coconut, and leads a menu inspired by cuisines of the 20th parallel north (India, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Mexico, Cuba). Items—small bites and larger plates—include a variety of dumplings, skewered foods, Thai crispy rice, whole fish with Mala sauce, Baja-style mussels, and Grandma’s hot chicken.
The well-appointed bar is run by Nobie’s bar director Sarah Troxell, who is going deep on low ABV and balanced cocktails, while also trying to open up hearts and minds on the versatility of rum. Don’t worry—large-format cocktails and boozier offerings are available. Look for the Seaward (Rhum J.M. blanc, coconut water, lime, mint, falernum) and Low Tide (oloroso sherry, Stolen overproof Jamaican rum, pecan orgeat, orange
curacao
, lime, bitters) among others, presented in vintage tiki mugs, coconuts, and other kinds of glassware.
Along with that, the beer and wine list curated by Sara Stayer focuses on bitter and floral IPAs, plus easy-drinking lagers like Pacifico, Tecate, and the rice-based Yuzu Lager from Japan. All wines are served by the glass.
The Toasted Coconut Aims to Be Your Tropical Playground.
SEPT 19
The Toasted Coconut
, 1617 Richmond, opened September 4.  This is the second concept for husband and wife duo, Chef Martin Stayer and Sara Stayer, of Nobie’s Restaurant. The full service restaurant claims to be the first tiki-ispired concept in Houston to offer a chef-curated menu.
Bar Director Sarah Troxell has created a cocktail menu inspired by her enthusiasm for the tiki culture, which will include 17 libations using various liquors and other spirits bases including some low ABV options. Cocktails like Jamaica Me Crazy with Absolut Lime, hibiscus, cherry, lime, and Topo Chico or the Low Tide, with Oloroso sherry, Stolen Overproof Jamaican rum, pecan
orgeat
, orange
curacao
, lime and bitters will transport Houstonians from the streets of Montrose to the beaches of Maui. The waterfall feature will help as well. Troxell will focus on using fresh juices, shrubs and homemade liqueurs in the cocktails. Drinks will be presented in vintage tiki mugs, coconuts or fun glassware with unique garnishes. Tiki-inspired cocktails will be a highlight of the bar program, but there are plenty of classic mixed drinks and spirits available as well.

SEPT 19
Inside, the design features Polynesian masks, custom furniture, and a vintage poster from the movie She Gods of Shark Reef. A small portion of the 2,850-square-foot interior has been devoted to ""the cool kid's lounge,"" which features an astroturf floor and beach chairs.
On the menu, chef Stayer and chef de cuisine Ben Ruiz have created a menu inspired by the countries within 20 degrees north or south of the Equator. Some favorites from the Toasty Tuesdays preview pop-ups made it to the final menu, including three kinds of dumplings, pineapple pastor skewers, and mapo tofu waffles fries. Additions to the menu include more skewers (beef, lamb, chicken, mushroom, and coconut shrimp), salads, and bar snacks. Larger format entrees include fried chicken, whole fish with mala sauce, and vegan chickpea curry with roti and fried cauliflower.
Troxell, the reigning
CultureMap Tastemaker Awards
bartender of the year, takes a lighter, slightly less boozy approach to traditional tiki drinks — although most are still served in tiki mugs, coconuts, or vintage glassware. The Low Tide (oloroso sherry, Stolen overproof Jamaican rum, pecan orgeat, etc.) is a refreshing take on the Mai Tai. In addition to rum-based drinks, patrons will find a couple of tequila cocktails, including the Resting Beach Face, a bottled cocktail that must be shaken prior to drinking. Of course, the bar can still make simple highballs (Jack and Coke, vodka-soda, etc.) for those who want to stick to familiar flavors.

WHEN YOU STEP INTO THE TOASTED COCONUT
—the new tiki bar from
Nobie
’s owners Martin and Sara Stayer, set to open this summer at the former Maria Selma location on Richmond—order Sarah Troxell’s The Lost Word.
The drink is made with fresh-sugar-cane-derived rhum agricole, passion fruit liqueur, green chartreuse, and lime juice; served in a coupe glass; and garnished with a lime wedge, maraschino cherry, and paper umbrella. It carries a tart punch, earthy, grassy notes, and a subtle sweetness. Nothing overpowers.
“We’re looking to bring different spirits to the party,” says Troxell, who will most certainly rock one of her many Hawaiian shirts while mixing up cocktails. “A lot of tiki cocktails obviously focus on rum and sugar-cane spirits, which I love. But bringing things like tequila and mezcal and gin and whiskey and brandy and your off-the-beaten-path spirits to a tropical, beachy environment is definitely something we’re excited to do.”
The Toasted Coconut Promises a Tropical Getaway in Montrose
. July 19
Is it getting toasty in here, or is it just us? Answer: it definitely is, thanks to chef
Martin Stayer
and sommelier Sara Stayer and bar manager Sarah Troxell, the masterminds behind Nobie’s.
It’s a tiki takeover at the formerTexas Shrimp Shack space, with tropical dishes galore, especially dumplings, skewers and other top-notch shareables. Martin Stayer says if it touches the 20th parallel, he’ll work it into the kitchen. The Indonesian “queso” is really roti in a sweet curry sauce, and the Crispy Rice Salad is taken out of the Vietnamese handbook.
As for the drinks — prepare for some mind-numbing, rum-heavy classics like the Painkiller, Mai Tai, Zombie and Planter’s Punch — alongside some Troxell signatures, featuring everything from blended scotch to rhum Agricole from the Caribbean.

June 19
Nobie's Restaurant owners chef Martin Stayer and his wife, Sara Stayer, are set to debut The Toasted Coconut, a tiki bar at 1617 Richmond Avenue, in the space that once housed Maria Selma. Tiki bars have seen a resurgence in recent years, including around Houston, but this one promises to be the first with chef-driven food on the menu, too. ""It's going to be fun playing with the bright flavors of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia,"" chef Martin Stayer said in a prepared statement. ""I am very excited to provide a great place to hang out regardless of whether you are drinking, eating or both. Let's get toasted, Houston."" Expect a late summer debut and a fun design that promises to be reminiscent of a beach bar, but set in Montrose.

June 19
The team behind Nobie’s — chef Martin Stayer, sommelier Sara Stayer, and bar manager Sarah Troxell — will celebrate their
love of all things tiki
at this Montrose restaurant that replaces Maria Selma’s/Texas Shrimp Shack. The food menu features dishes inspired by countries within 20 degrees of the equator with a focus on shareable items like skewers and dumplings. Cocktails will both pay homage to classics like the Zombie and the Painkiller and offer alternatives that don't rely on rum and sweet juices.
If the recent presence of Peter Jahnke (Tongue-cut Sparrow) behind the bar at Nobie’s is any indication of future staff, the Stayers will launch the concept with a talented, veteran crew. Send positive thoughts for a mid-to-late-July opening.

Bartender of the Year: Sarah Troxell, Nobie’s
Once upon a time, Troxell cooked on the Eatsie Boys food truck, but stints at Coltivare and Nobie’s have firmly established her as one of the city’s top bartending talents. Her daily libations at Nobie’s always featuring intriguing combinations, and her skills behind the bar propelled her to a win in the regional finals of the prestigious Speed Rack bartending competition.

Three years of practice and training finally paid off for Troxell
when she won
the South Central finals of the Speed Rack bartending competition to advance to the national finals in Chicago. Win or lose, Troxell is poised for a busy 2019. Later this summer, her affection for all things tiki will reach full bloom when she assumes control of The Toasted Coconut, the new bar and restaurant from Nobie’s owners Sara and Martin Stayer. If the turnout for a recent preview pop-up of tiki drinks and bites is any indication of the excitement surrounding the project, Houstonians can’t wait for Troxell to put her spin on boozy, rum-based drinks.

Chef Manny Velasquez is a culinary leader whose journey from humble beginnings in his mother’s

                    nourish but also connect people, reflecting his belief that to eat well is to live well.
Today, Chef Manny serves as Executive Director of Culinary at Granger’s Restaurant in Houston’s
