Ninos has been around for so long because they never disappoint. Weâve gone on random date nights and a few valentines dates and the food/service is always top notch.
Cathy Winkler
We had a delicious lunch at Nino's in the perfect bright yellow blue and white surroundings. The hostess Alessandra and owner was very hospitable and attentive to everyone there even chasing after customers who forgot their boxed leftovers and another couple a sweater too. I had a dish with a pasta I've never had

before calamarata pasta with rapini and sausage in a delicious delicate herb sauce. Micah the chef and co-owner came out to check on the guests as they ate. it was a great dining experience. I can't wait to try out the dinner menu it looks intoxicating!

Every time I go the service is amazing, the food is delicious, and the environment is very reminiscent of Italian style restaurants I would have experienced the child in New York... Just a lot of fun! I highly recommend the restaurant, however, in this world of not

Finally open at the new location
Welcome back to Pasta da Pulcinella!
We are delighted to serve you again from our new location at 1100 West Peachtree St. NW, in the heart of Midtown Atlanta. Come and enjoy the charm of our new yellow house – a completely renovated 1924 historic bungalow featuring dedicated private event space, two bars, spacious patio seating, and pizza oven.
We are most grateful to our patrons, for allowing our dreams to continue, and for trusting us to host your first date, your proposal dinner, your wedding rehearsal, your anniversary, your family gatherings, and your business events since 1994. We look forward to resuming our tradition of excellence, and we thank you for being a crucial part of our continued success.
Pulcinella
originated as a character in the 17th Century Commedia dell’ Arte; it is a symbol of effervescence, joviality, and facing uncertainty of the future. These characteristics are not only reflected in the extraordinary Domenico Tiepolo Pulcinella drawings that adorn our walls, but also in the lively buzz, friendly service, and Chef Bibbiano’s creative menu offerings, with his renowned signature dish:
Tortelli di Mele
— round ravioli filled with Granny Smith apples, sausage, and parmigiano topped with brown butter and sage.

Chef Bibbiano, Head Chef at Pasta da Pulcinella
Since 1994, Pasta Da Pulcinella has been a place of the reknown Zagat Survey, Frommer’s Guide to Atlanta, and a host to nation-wide clientele. In 2000, the restaurant moved off Peachtree street in favor of a more intimate atmosphere. Pasta Da Pulcinella has undergone changes but has maintained the classic appeal that made it famous. Table linens, oil paintings of Tuscany, classic melodies, and the scent of fresh pasta fill the air.
Chef Bibbiano has been the heart of Pasta Da Pulcinella for over fifteen years. He diligently maintains the restaurant’s original menu, all the while creating additional dishes each week with the freshest ingredients. Unassuming and quick with a smile, Chef Bibbiano keeps his small kitchen full of laughter and the joy he gets from his work.

After traveling to Naples and throughout the entire region, owners Stephen de Haan & Greg Grant staged with the Italian Pizzaiolo
Maestros at Pizzeria Mattozzi and Pizzeria Da Attilio. This apprenticeship, along with studying in the Associazione Verace Pizza
Napolentana, allowed their passion for food to develop the skills to bring this beautifully executed Italian street food to Atlanta."

Home of the Snickerdoodle Pancake
Welcome to Baja Café!
Baja Café, located in sunny Tucson AZ, has two locations, one at 7002 E Broadway and one at 2970 N Campbell. We are a locally owned and operated full-service restaurant serving breakfast, brunch and lunch… traditional meals and many with a Southwestern flair. We love to offer guests dishes they will not find elsewhere!
We have grown to be known for our variety of eggs benedicts… we’ve come a long way from the classic benedict (which we offer!) to serving benedicts with a variety of bases, smoked (in house) meats, fresh veggies, and house made sauces.
Many of our guests come in for one of our mouth-watering, fluffy, made-from-scratch pancakes! Our classic cake is the Snickerdoodle! We also offer other varieties, from cinnamon roll to lemon-blueberry to strawberry. We have freshly made cinnamon rolls which we turn into our brioche French toast! And a favorite of many of our guests is our Liege Waffle. It is a different kind of waffle than the traditional kind many have had and a part of that is the Belgium pearl sugar which melts and caramelizes as the waffle cooks. It is truly something special.
Our huevos rancheros options are also favorites of our guests. They are packed with flavor with our crispy tostada shells, house made sauces (many with chiles straight out of Hatch!), and variety of house smoked and prepared meats, beans and veggies.
Don’t forget to try one of our amazing mimosas or tangy Bloody Mary’s!
Cheers and we hope to see you soon!

About Us
While we are proud of the food our amazing team prepares every day, we also strive to offer our guests top notch service. Tucson, AZ is full of so many amazing and local restaurants… we are very honored to be a part of that magic! That being said, our guests have many great options so when they choose Baja Café we want to make sure they like it so much they will return and tell someone else about us! Those guests are the ones who have helped us grow
over the years.
Our serving team works to make sure our guests feel welcome and comfortable when they
come in and say thank you when folks leave. It is such a wonderful feeling to look across our dining areas and see so much diversity with our guests… dressed up, dressed down; old, young; families, single, couples; DMAFB military, students, nurses, U of A sports team members and
coaches; friends and family coming together to celebrate or share some quality time with one another. We want everyone to feel welcome every time they come.

Pets are also welcome at both locations! It is such a joy for all of us when our guests bring their furry friends in! Baja Café supports our area rescue organizations and the tireless work they do. Adopt Don’t Shop and don’t forget to spay/neuter!
Thank you to our amazing team and thank you Tucson and all those who visit and support us. You are the best!!!!

At Varasano's, we use only all natural ingredients and are one of the few pizzerias in the U.S. that make dough the old fashioned way, using only natural sourdough yeasts, fermented for several days. Because the pies are very thin, flash baked in just about 2 1/2 minutes, and use no dough conditioners, they are delicate and best enjoyed sparsely topped and without a knife and fork. Just pick it up, fold it and chow down!
Dinner 7 days, from 5:30pm

CHEF FORD FRY’S COOK BOOK!
Tex-Mex
is more than just a flavor-packed cookbook of tried and true recipes for comfort-food favorites like nachos, fajitas, and chili—it’s a way of life. It was born in the 1940s when traditional Northern Mexican cuisine collided with the robust flavors of Texas ranchers’ kitchens. Now, chef and restaurateur Ford Fry presents the definitive book on the topic with craveable recipes that are heavy on flavor and light on fuss. Peppered throughout are jump-off-the-page photographs, helpful ingredient explainers, playful histories, and important cooking tips. These melty, crispy, hot-as-heck classics include Dirty Breakfast Tacos, Grilled Shrimp Diablo, Cheese Enchiladas Con Chili Gravy, Sopaipillas with Local Honey, and more salsas than you can imagine. Pour yourself a Classic Margarita on the Rocks—don’t forget to salt the rim—and get ready to satisfy the rumble in your stomach.

ABOUT US
At age 15, Rosalia Ruiz started selling traditional food an snacks in her home state of origin in Oaxaca, Mexico. In 1995, she had the opportunity to travel to the USA with her husband, Oscar Arteaga, arriving at Dekalb County in Georgia. During a visit to a local flea market, Rosalia came up with the idea of selling traditional Mexican food. With very few resources and a very basic grasp of the English language, they began to sell tamales.
After two years, Rosalia and Oscar saved up enough money to buy a food truck, which was located on North Harston Rd, at Stone Mountain. After years of struggles and perseverance, they were able to expand their business to a brick and mortar location in Clayton County on 6768 Tara Boulevard.  For five years, “Taqueria La Oaxaqueña” operated at that location, where they earned the loyalty of their clients with their delicious traditional Oaxacan food.
As the clientele grew, so did the need for a bigger space, so they moved to the current location at 605 Mt Zion Rd in Jonesboro. Their menu includes Oaxacan Mole, Tlayudas, Quesillo, Tacos, Burritos, Tamales, Seafood, and many more traditional Mexican dishes.
Taqueria La Oaxaqueña has received awards from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and The Zagat. It is also included in the list of top 50 restaurants in Atlanta by Atlanta Magazine and has been voted best Mexican Restaurant in Atlanta by Creative Loafing.

Reviews
“Best Indian food! Our family has friends in Udaipur that we visit often. Aamar’s food makes us feel like we’re sitting at our friend, Samvit’s kitchen table with him. Fills our hearts & tummies with love!”
– Asha
“Phenomenal food, the coconut soup is the best thing I’ve ever let my palate experience! The Tandoori wings took me out as well! Slammin food! Fast delivery!”
– Candace
“Aamar is one of the best spots in Atlanta for old-school Indian takeaway. We were highly impressed on a recent delivery order after a night out. We both went classic and ordered paneer but tikka, mild for her, medium spicy for mine, and I appreciated the spice personalization option. Both were great, and paired perfectly with the tandoori naan. I will definitely be ordering again when in the mood for real-deal Indian.”

Best Indian Food | Curry Up Now Menu
California is home to the largest population of Indians outside of India and our style of cooking is ~9,000 miles and ~125 years in the making. Traditional rituals with flavor-forward flair. Firmly familiar to some and fantastically fun for all. Indian at heart while Californian in spirit. This is your Auntie’s tikka wrapped in your Tía’s burrito...Bombay tandoori riding with Bay Area burgers...New Delhi naan if pizza-fied by SoCal surfers. You’ve had thalis and kathis and biryanis in the past. But this is Curry Up Now: the hyphenated hero of the Indo-Californian kitchen, remixing street food from the Land of Spices with culinary classics from the Land of Dreams.

Start your meal with any of our irresistible side orders and wings. We have everything from onion rings and mozzarella sticks to pizza fries and boneless wings.

For something fresh, choose one of our delicious salads. Our Greek, Caesar, and Chef's salad are all a great option.

As the right substitute for pizza, grab our chicken, steak, or regular cheese calzone. Our veggie stromboli is amazing, too.

Furthermore, we offer a variety of subs such as our meatballs, Philly cheesesteak, chicken Philly, hot Italian sub, and others.

On top of that, our menu features dishes from a few different cuisines. Hence, we serve great-tasting Indian and Jamaican food, as well as shawarmas and gyros. 
We also provide a fantastic selection of pasta dishes including our spaghetti, ravioli, and lasagna.

For seafood lovers, we offer items such as our crab cakes, jumbo shrimp, and a shrimp basket.

Finally, you can finish your meal on a sweet note with one of our outstanding desserts. Enjoy our cheesecake, Red Velvet cake (a must-try!), classic apple pie, or perhaps some refreshing ice cream.

Stop by for lunch or dinner at your earliest convenience. Our friendly staff is eager to serve you. Of course, you can also order online for pickup or delivery and enjoy our delicious food comfortably at home. See you soon!

Best Indian Food | Curry Up Now Menu
California is home to the largest population of Indians outside of India and our style of cooking is ~9,000 miles and ~125 years in the making. Traditional rituals with flavor-forward flair. Firmly familiar to some and fantastically fun for all. Indian at heart while Californian in spirit. This is your Auntie’s tikka wrapped in your Tía’s burrito...Bombay tandoori riding with Bay Area burgers...New Delhi naan if pizza-fied by SoCal surfers. You’ve had thalis and kathis and biryanis in the past. But this is Curry Up Now: the hyphenated hero of the Indo-Californian kitchen, remixing street food from the Land of Spices with culinary classics from the Land of Dreams.

Welcome
Among metro Atlanta's 100-plus Chinese restaurants are two that would belong in any listing of the top 20: The Golden Buddha and China Gate.
We quit eating at the decade-old Golden Buddha, with it's big buddha guarding the door, three years ago because the food and service had gone from being some of the best in Atlanta to ranking among the worst. We recently went back and found great improvements.
The service, provided by smiling young waiters, is cheery and friendly now. But the major change has been in the quality and visual appeal of the food. Dishes that were previously marred by the flabby, over-cooked vegetables and chewy, flavorless meats are subtly seasoned works of art today. The crisp vegetables are a palate of colors on the plate. The meats and seafood are fresh.
While the Golden Buddha is best known for it's mandarin style of cooking, spicier Szechuan dishes are also available. One of the best of the restaurant's incendiary dishes is Sa-Cha shrimp, a lip-puckering blend of shrimp, mixed vegetables and red pepper. The hot braised fish, a whole red snapper topped with onion, ground pork and hot peppers, is another sure-to-please dish, but on that will make you grab for your water glass after the first bite or two.
For milder, and a good complement to the Szechuan dishes, are Chow Fen Sz, strands of bean thread noodles, mixed with pork and vegetables, or the soft Lo Mein noodles served with pork or chicken.
The restaurant's two large dining rooms, lined with booths and tables are inviting and comfortable and generally crowded with a mix of Chinese an American families and Emory students and employees from the nearby Centers of Disease Control.

Q:
How would you order of you don't eat everything in the variety bowl that it comes with? Would you just choose soup, meat, and then order individual sides? Seems like that would quickly add up.
A:
If it's one or two things they'll let you sub something else that already comes on the platter. Example, I don't like tomato or egg. So I say no tomato or egg but could I please have extra enoki and oysters mushrooms and they do.

Keith H:
Having lived in Woodstock for several years now and searched the area the one thing missing was the lack of a good Chinese or Asian restaurant of any kind. It may be more expensive than the others as some have said but it is much much better than any others in the area...
review by - Yelp
Samantha M:
My daughter and I tried this restaurant tonight and ordered a variety of dishes to sample. She is vegetarian and there were so many items for her to choose from. The masaman roti was very good - the roti were flaky and the sauce was very tasty...
review by - Yelp
Larry B:
Excellent food, service, and many gluten free options too!!! A very comfortable, casual dining atmosphere that is really enjoyable. Also, since were have food allergies, the staff are very helpful with our selections and ensuring the kitchen is made aware of the situation.
review by - Yelp
Katy S:
Hidden gem! This place is amazing! I've been to more Thai restaurants than I can count, and all over... scouts honor. But this restaurant pays very particular attention to detail. Very impressed... And they're open until 10 pm most days...

PHONE ISSUES
Having trouble getting through? Do not fret! If both lines are occupied, our phone makes weird sounds. Just try again a minute or two later!
DIETARY RESTRICTIONS
Vegetarian/Vegan, Gluten Free, Dairy Free, Nut Free and most other standard allergies or dietary restrictions can be accommodated nightly through our a la carte menu but not our prix fixe menu. For more complicated allergies, we can usually accommodate with at least a few days advance warning. Regardless, please make a note when booking on Resy so we can make you the best, safest food possible for you without sacrificing flavor! Xoxo
An open ended digital cookbook written month to month in real time with dish & cocktail recipes from our current menu! A traditional cookbook is still in the plans eventually but those feel so permanent and stuck in time, which goes against the very nature of Little Bear and how we source. Our restaurant is hyper seasonal and focused on the fleeting, ephemeral and ever changing nature of genuine seasonal cooking so why would we not find a way to make a cookbook that reflects our style?

What could possibly improve our Tanzanian Chipsi Mayai, Shakshuka, and Moroccan Spice Avocado Toast?
Enjoying them over brunch with someone special.
And perhaps...
Live jazz? We`ve got that, too.
Crafted mimosas? Perfected.
See you for brunch this weekend.

Your night out deserves to feel like an escape — a world apart where the pace slows, the noise softens, and you’re wrapped in a sense of ease.
Verdure is the place that welcomes you in with the warmth of an African sunset, where conversations flow like water from an oasis and evenings are made just as magical.
Step out of Atlanta`s whirlwind without traveling far — we beat to the drum of Atlanta`s heart, nestled beside Piedmont Park.
See you for dinner.

Two years of Verdure.
Two years of evenings that feel like a world apart.
This September, we mark the occasion with a three-day culinary journey celebrating the flavors of Kenya, Côte d’Ivoire, and South Africa through the lens of Chef Jean-Louis Sangare.
🥂 Starters – Kenya
Swahili coconut prawn curry bisque, kachumbari salad, and fire-kissed nyama choma carpaccio.
🍴 Mains – Ivory Coast
Braised beef short ribs, branzino with tomato concassé, and the Abidjan pepper-crusted ribeye.
🍰 Desserts – South Africa
Amarula malva cake, milk tart cheesecake, and the irresistible sticky tipsy tart.
Each course is a story — coastal spice, smoky braise, nostalgic sweetness — woven together to honor where we’ve been and where we’re going.
Join us September 5 – 7 for an anniversary weekend that feels intimate, transportive, and unforgettable.
✨ Reserve your evening.
Midtown, steps from Piedmont Park.

✨ Your evening deserves magic.
Crisp-edged octopus, silken corn purée, a whisper of verdure oil, and that crisp flavor of pickled onion, this dish is everything Wednesday was missing.
Meet Chef Jean-Louis Sangare`s Crispy Fried Octopus.
The kind of plate that invites silence, then a reach across the table.
The kind of night that calls for another round and on Wednesdays, the second martini or glass of wine is our gift to you.
Seeing us on Thursday? Our handcrafted margaritas take center stage, a weekly ritual for those who appreciate a little citrus and spice.
Walk in or reserve. We’re pouring, plating, and redefining what a weeknight can be.

We are a modern Spanish restaurant combining the tastes of Spain, with a fresh, eclectic, American social atmosphere. The focus of our menu is on traditional cured meats and Spanish cheese and tapas. While we spend a great deal of time honoring traditional Spanish flavor combinations we are also inspired by modern techniques and culinary creativity. In addition, we also place a strong emphasis on our beverage program - including a focused wine list comprised of selections from Spain, Chile and Argentina and a cocktail list that consists of faithful classics and our signature combinations.

About the Business
5Church Buckhead offers a modern American dining experience that seamlessly blends casual and refined elements. Our menu is driven by technique, and paired with cutting-edge design and genuine hospitality. The atmosphere is truly unique, with a gallery-like feel. The restaurant prominently features local and regional artists, including a ceiling mural of Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War"" by Atlanta-based artist Dr. Dax. Just like our sister location in Midtown Atlanta, it's a place where you can enjoy great food and art at the same time.

INFORMATION
Our Menus
We buy the freshest ingredients we can find.
We cook seasonally because that’s what is fresh and best. We support local farmers and businesses whenever we can, because it’s the right thing to do and the best flavor naturally follows. We believe that great food is best enjoyed with friends and family. We try to be “green” whenever we can. We believe in sustainability, both environmentally and fiscally. In the end, it all comes back to that little mantra:
you can’t argue with delicious.
Our chefs like to keep things fresh (literally). The menus online are a solid guide, but not a legally binding document. The offerings below may be subject to change.

Seasonal Menu
At True Food Kitchen, our menu is carefully crafted so that every bite and every refreshing sip serve up big flavor, an abundance of fresh ingredients and a taste of the unexpected. Our artisan chefs create crave-worthy classics alongside a steady rotation of seasonal offerings that take advantage of naturally ripe fruits and vegetables so their flavor is full and their nutrients, rich. Creative, hand-crafted beverages built around seasonality, quality ingredients and simple preparations complement every occasion from brunch, lunch, dinner and, of course, dessert. Always room for dessert.
Important Information About Our Menu
Menu pricing varies by location – to view location-specific menus, visit our
locations
page.
*These items may be served raw or undercooked. Consuming raw or undercooked meats, poultry, seafood, shellfish, or eggs may increase your risk of foodborne illness, especially if you have certain medical conditions.
Please be aware that our restaurants use gluten and ingredients that contain all the major FDA allergens (peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, fish, shellfish, milk, sesame, soy and wheat).
Our restaurants have shared cooking and preparation areas and the possibility exists for food items to come into contact with other food products. Due to these circumstances, we are unable to guarantee that any menu item can be completely free of allergens. In addition, while effort is made to keep our product information current and as complete as possible, it is possible that ingredient changes and substitutions may occur due to differences in regional suppliers, recipe revisions, preparation techniques, and/or the season of the year.
Before placing your order, please inform your server if someone in your party has a food allergy or a special dietary need and we will do our best to make accommodations.

Testimonials
Best Persian on the East Coast. Alway have the lamb rack. Seasoned and cooked to tender perfection with saffron rice and roast tomato. Their complementary hot flat bread (ask for it crispy) with feta, basil and radishes are a treat! The grape leaves delish. 

If you have enough appetite (or a large group) get the rice pot bottom with meat sauce appetizer. A meal in itself! Finish off with the homemade rosewater ice cream. 

Simple family-style and friendly environment. Ocassional bellydancer…

I was there for the buffet and was treated well by the staff. I am african american, I do speak some Farsi, but they were not aware of that at first, They came right over and explained the menu and service. (maybe it has changed owners?) My favorite item is torshi with my food. the rice dishes are awesome. I will return .I am aware of their cultural issues. Forwardness/rudeness is an un -comfortable issue for any culture.

Who doesn’t like giant well seasoned mea t kebabs? At Persepolis, the main show is the wonderfully seasoned meats, shrimp and chicken. When I went, everything was near perfect. The chicken was a little dry, but the tender and juicy beef made up for it. To start they bring out some fresh baked Persian bread, with some nuts and cheese. There was also an eggplant salad that we ordered, that may have been the best thing having to do with eggplants I have ever had. If you are in the mood for Persian …

DIBAR GRILL
We are the only place in Georgia baking authentic and fresh Sangak Bread daily, so it certainly is another reason for you to try Persian flavors at DiBAR Grill. We have also had a lot of people asking what is Sangak bread. Its name consists of two parts, Sang in Persian means Stone or Pebble and Sangak means little stone. The bread is baked on a small bed of river stones in an oven. Sangak bread was traditionally the bread of the Persian Royal family and the earliest mention of this bread dates back to the 19th century! Sangak Bread is eaten along with Lamb Kabab.

Thank you!
“Sabich Pita at Yalla: No offense to the falafel or shawarma, but there’s one sandwich that stands above all others in the canon of Israeli cuisine, and that is the sabich pita. The foundation is fried eggplant, and Yalla has mastered the art, producing slices that are tender, smoky and dare we say, meaty? But the secret ingredient is the neon orange amba, made from mango and sundry spices. As with all Yalla dishes, feel free to customize, but the standard sabich composition with hummus, labne, tahini and hard-boiled egg is practically perfect.”

TESTIMONIALS
What Our Visitors Say
“Delicious food, and fantastic environment. Passing through while traveling, and didn’t have anything specific in mind. Sorted by rating, and hit a jackpot. I’ve never had falafel before, but it was good. Reminds me of hush puppies, which I don’t like. Hush puppies have always given me the impression of being leftover fish breading dropped into a frier. In contrast, the falafel has a satisfying blend of textures, with a mild flavor. The sauce(?) it comes with paired perfectly.
I got the shish tawook plate, which was even better. I was curious about something that marinated chicken in yogurt, and I wasn’t disappointed. The chicken was moist with plenty of seasoning. It went well with the tzatziki sauce when I put it in the pita bread with my salad.”

What Our Visitors Say
“La Shish Kabob is amazing!!! Each time we visit Atlanta I make sure to stop by La Shish Kabob to get some of their amazing food. I’ve had several of their amazing dishes including Chicken Kafta, Lamb Loins, and the Shrimp. The Chicken was marinated to perfection and very juicy. The Lamb may be my favorite I’ve ever had as it was juicy, tender, and super flavorful. The Shrimp were delicious too. The salad was fresh and the dressing was delicious. The rice was so good and not at all dry like most rice usually is when you get it at restaurants. The hummus was fresh and creamy, you could tell it was made in house. I would totally recommend this wonderful restaurant for delicious Mediterranean cuisine. To top the beautiful and flavorful food off, the owners were so nice and made me feel so welcome.”

Have a Taste of Our Delectable Mediterranean Dishes
Welcome
We use only the best ingredients that keep customers coming back time and again
Supporting the community was a no-brainer for us. We proudly sponsored local events, rallied behind nearby schools, and took part in initiatives that aimed to strengthen our community’s bonds. It was all about giving back to the place that welcomed us with open arms.
Quality was at the heart of everything we did. Freshness was our mantra, and every dish was a testament to our commitment to using the best ingredients. From scratch, we crafted culinary creations that were a symphony of flavors, a dance of spices that echoed the authenticity of the Mediterranean.
As we spread our wings to Cumming, Georgia, we were met with the same warmth and enthusiasm. Our journey continued, our story unfolding in a new setting. The House of Hummus Mediterranean Café wasn’t just a name; it was a reflection of my passion for sharing the joy of Mediterranean cuisine and creating a hub where people could come together.
So, here’s to more chapters, more memories, and more delicious moments. The story of House of Hummus is far from over, and I’m excited to see where the next pages take us.
Serving Healthy and Richly Flavored Mediterranean Dishes
We're a Family Business
﻿
For over a decade, we’ve been on an incredible journey, serving the Alpharetta, Georgia area with a taste of the Mediterranean. And now, our journey has taken us to the lovely town of Cumming, Georgia.
From day one, ou
plinko
r goal was clear: to create a space where the vibrant flavors of the Mediterranean could shine. Being locally owned and operated was important to us; it meant we were more than just a café – we were a part of the community’s fabric. Our mission went beyond serving food; it was about creating a gathering place where relationships were formed and stories were shared.
Fans of tasty and healthy food have long liked hummus – a dish with a rich history and many variations. The House Hummus company not only offers classic and original recipes, but also creates a food culture where natural ingredients and high quality products come to the fore. In conditions when you want to eat healthy, but without compromising on taste, such offers become especially relevant.

It is interesting that a balanced diet is important not only for the body, but also for the mind. This is especially true for gamers and those who spend a lot of time at the computer. It turns out that proper nutrition can directly affect concentration, reaction and even endurance during the gameplay. You can read more about this on the website
food-monitor.de
– there are specific examples of the influence of nutrition on cognitive functions and tips on how to improve gaming results with simple changes in the diet.

This approach combines two worlds – gastronomic and digital. And hummus can take a significant place here: rich in proteins, fiber and healthy fats, it can be a great alternative to fast food for those who want to feel energetic even in the midst of a gaming marathon.

Q:
Do most of their cones stop almost as low as the cone?
A:
No, you have the option to get petite or a regular size which reflects the amount of soft serve. Their is only one size of the waffle cone. That's why in some of the cones you see the soft serve isn't piled so high. Get a regular if you want more…

Testimonials
“
The first time I visited Life Bistro was on Valentine’s Day. My date and I ordered just about everything on the menu because we wanted to taste EVERYTHING! I can honestly say that everything we tried was LOVE in your mouth. I can’t pick one dish that I’d prefer over another so I just order something different every time I go. The staff is so accommodating and friendly. The ambiance is a str8 vibe! Definitely my go-to date night spot.
