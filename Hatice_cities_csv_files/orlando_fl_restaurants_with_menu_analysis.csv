The feeling: priceless. The buzz: optional (but highly recommended).
$40 for three courses. Add a cocktail, and now it’s a main event.
Start with a Wallop, dig into chicken parm, finish with apple-ricotta donuts and a food-induced emotional spiral.
Now through Sept 30, dinner’s got drama, dessert, and maybe a little buzz.

Don’t Bring Home Our Pizza Unless You’ve Got the Stones to Do it Right
Because our dough has ZERO artificial ingredients, our pizza must be eaten right out of our oven for true authentic flavor. If you plan on bringing one home, we strongly suggest (like really, really strongly) you purchase one of our pizza stones. They’re only $20 and last forever. And, it’s the best way to recreate that same V Pizza flavor at home.
Here’s how:
Place the stone in your oven and crank it as high as it goes.
Put your pizza on the HOT stone for 60 seconds.
And boom! You’re back in Naples eating pizza the way it was intended.
Molto Bene!
Pizza Stones $20 at select locations.

Great Sunday Brunch
A great way to celebrate a Sunday! Nice Jazz with the singer in the background, a very good buffet, and excellent service. We feasted on their snow crabs brought steaming to the table and their fresh oysters. Our server ensured that we never ran low on food or our bottomless mimosas!
Kalu W./TripAdvisor
The Best
I came for Brunch, and it was absolutely phenomenal. They had live music with an extensive selection of food. To top it off, they had unlimited oysters and crab legs with bottomless mimosas. Definitely worth the price.

Beverage Menu
Barrel Aged Cocktails
Smuggler's Courage
Patience is a virtue. We start with a brown butter washed blend of Brugal 1888 & Woodford Reserve bourbon. After that, we leave it to mature in charred virgin American oak barrels for 4-6 weeks. When it has reached the pinnacle of it's development, we add our house made spice rack demerara syrup for a transcendent cocktail experience. Infused with orange aroma and presented tableside.
36.
Bespoke Gentleman
Not for the faint of heart, our take on the classic boulevardier reaches new heights. Our blend of Michter's rye, Campari, and Carpano Antica become infused with coca nibs and barrel aged for 4-6 weeks in a charred virgin american oak barrel. Presented with fire tableside, with a high proof orange infusion.

Not for the faint of heart, our take on the classic boulevardier reaches new heights. Our blend of Michter's rye, Campari, and Carpano Antica become infused with coca nibs and barrel aged for 4-6 weeks in a charred virgin american oak barrel. Presented with fire tableside, with a high proof orange infusion.

Q:
Is this the same company/food as the location on 4565 W Irlo Bronson Memorial? I love that place but it is SO tiny inside and you always have to wait.
A:
Yes

Q:
Is it good for a group of about 30 people?
A:
It's a small restaurant, but I'm sure if you call ahead they can arrange their tables to seat two rows of 15 possibly.

Walked in on a Saturday evening and was seated immediately. The atmosphere was great, I love hearing native Spanish speaking at a Mexican restaurant. Sat at a nice table across from the bar, not crowded at all. Music was good volume and popular Spanish music. Bar had a good ambiance and guests seemed happy. Bartender changed the channels for a couple of people at request. Food was very fast and tasted amazing. Pricing was very reasonable and margaritas was very tasteful and strong.

We split a parrillada platter — a little more towards the high end of the menu, but absolutely delicious, and we both ate our fill, brought home leftovers, and had plenty for the next day.

Crown him the Mimosa King 👑🍊
Steven’s been bringing the juice (literally) since May 2024.
Starting as a Busser and quickly leveling up, Steven now plays a vital role behind the bar, prepping every fresh juice from scratch.
And fun fact: Tango is a family affair, with his brother also on the team!
When he’s not powering through service, Steven’s winning at Mario Kart, fixing up cars, cooking up killer Jerk Chicken, or watching his favorite action-comedy flick, Sinners.
Versatile, vibrant, and always down to help, Steven’s the kind of teammate every restaurant dreams of. 🎮🍗🎬

In 1985, Don Sacramento Rodríguez
opened one of the first Mexican restaurants
in the United States, in the city of Athens,
Georgia. There, he created along his wife
Josephine, also known as, Doña Pepa, the
most delicious recipes inspired by their
hometown Jalisco, Mexico.
Continuing the legacy of the Rodríguez
family, on September 6, 2014, his son
Florencio Rodríguez, opened the first Don
Julio Mexican Kitchen and Tequila Bar on
Chickasaw in Orlando, Florida. Florencio
continued to grow his family’s legacy
throughout Central Florida.

Q:
Is there MSG used?
A:
Why do you care? The war against MSG is anti-Asian propaganda. And ridiculous. (Unless you have an actual allergy)

Q:
Is this the same restaurant that's on the corner of Shine and Colonial Dr, across of Publix, and a door away to Saigon Market? I've moved away and discovered the old location has closed. And did a Yelp search, and saw ""another"" tasty wok restaurant.
A:
Yup, its the same. They have expanded.

What our customers say
Reviews
We have ordered takeout here a couple of times. They are always timely in preparing the order, every order has been correctly made and delicious. We love the Hot & Spicy Chicken, Pepper Steak, and Lo Mein. So good!
Richard W.
We are new here in Clermont and tried this place for the first time, and they did not disappoint! My partner and I had their General Tso's Chicken,  Mongolian Beef, and Coconut Shrimp. It was absolutely amazing! We will be back for sure.
Shelby O.
My family and I had a fantastic experience here. The service was amazing, the food came out hot and perfectly cooked and was so delicious. We are so grateful we chose to eat here, it made our night.
Brandon V.
I tried the house special chow mei fun and orange chicken with spring roll and wonton for an appetizer! Delicious food! Definitely taste homemade and fresh! Great proportions and price!
Tom F.
Picked up our first takeout order tonight, it was ready on time, packed well, hot, and had some of the tastiest Chinese food we've had. Would 100% recommend them and will definitely be back.
Carol C.
By far my favorite restaurant! You can order for pick up or have them delivered. Either way, you get your money's worth and it is delicious food! I have never had to wait long to get my order, and they are always punctual and polite.

SAME DAY SEATING REQUESTS MUST BE MADE BY PHONE. (407) 767-5918
Thank you for choosing Korea House Restaurant of Longwood.  Due to our high volume and traffic, we cannot hold tables for parties like a reservation system.  We have a system called Priority Seating.  This system secures a table within our restaurant; however, it does not guarantee an exact seat by time.  Priority is placed on your party, and if we are on a waitlist, your party is placed on top of the wait list as a priority.  We will seat you as fast as possible but cannot guarantee an exact time.
We don’t always seat parties according to the order in which they arrive, rather according to the size of the party and the tables that become available.

U & Me Revolving Hot Pot menu
Flavors That Delight
Each of U & Me’s broth options is carefully crafted to deliver a depth of flavor that tantalizes the taste buds. From the classic and comforting flavors of a traditional bone broth to the aromatic and spicy profiles of Sichuan and Thai broths, U & Me have something to satisfy every palate.
For those seeking a bold and robust taste, U & Me’s broth selection includes options such as a rich beef broth infused with herbs and spices, or a hearty mushroom broth that imparts earthy flavors. These broths create a savory foundation for your hot pot experience, allowing the ingredients to soak up the delicious essence and enhance their natural flavors.
Exquisite BoBa Tea Experience
BoBa Tea, also known as Bubble Tea, has become a beloved and trendy beverage enjoyed by people of all ages around the world. With its delightful combination of tea, chewy tapioca pearls, and a range of flavorful toppings, BoBa Tea offers a unique and refreshing experience.
The highlight of BoBa Tea lies in the addition of chewy tapioca pearls, which add a playful and satisfying element to each sip. These tapioca pearls, often referred to as “boba,” are made from cassava starch and are cooked until they achieve the perfect consistency—soft and chewy, yet not overly mushy. Their unique texture provides a delightful contrast to the smoothness of the tea, creating a pleasurable and fun drinking experience.

Q:
What service style is this restaurant? (Walk up to the counter and order or table service with wait staff)

I will be in town on Thursday and want to dine here , but I will only have 45 minutes between appointments.
A:
45 minutes is really pushing it. The restaurant has limited seating, and waits can be common, especially on weekends. It's the type of place where you’ll want to savor your meal without feeling rushed.

What our customers say
Reviews
This restaurant has the most delicious, and tasty dish, I have had anywhere. I love their food. Cooked perfectly, and timely. The cook is the BEST! The guy up front is nice and sociable.
Sandy Romkey
Stopped in for lunch while on a road trip. The food was delicious, fast, and fresh. The prices were fair and portions were HUGE. I will definitely stop by next time I am in this part of Florida!
Rachel Rhoat
Completely caught me off guard and exceeded my expectations. We took a chance with China Taste. Cashew Chicken, wings and pork chow mein were all wonderful.
Jefferson Cosgrove
Best chinese in town. Their chicken is so delicious, the texture is soooo good and that sauce on the general tsos and sesame is delicious. Fried rice is also very very good.
Kevin ONeil
Best Chinese takeout I’ve ever had. They are generous with the amount of meat in their fried rice and lo mein. Everything was of great quality and delicious. Portions are generous.
Laura C.
I've tried most of the Chinese food restaurants in st cloud, and this is by far my favorite. Their portions are extremely generous, staff is always friendly, and the food tastes great.

""Amazing decor at this Pho Restaurant. Very well done with sense of humor. Pho itself was delicious. We had seafood Pho and it was great. We also tried Curry Pho, which I never had before and it was amazing. The flavor was almost like Tom Kha in Thai Restaurant. It was my favorite. Great choice and highly recommended""

The Churrasco Experience
For more than a century, the Culinary Art of Churrasco, or cooking over an open flame,
                              has been skillfully mastered by the Gaucho Chefs of Brazil. Our Gauchos carefully
                              butcher, simply season and fire-roast each cut to seal in the natural flavors, producing
                              a salty bark and creating a unique and unforgettable culinary experience.

Grill
Beef
Maminha **
GF
This Tri-tip sirloin steak is unique to Rodizio Grill, the Brazilian steakhouse. This steak is a moderate marbled-to-lean cut, which makes it a very flavorful steak. It's our Founder’s favorite! This cut is best if consumed medium to medium rare.
Fraldinha **
GF
Fraldinha, beef tender, is tender and robust in flavor - one of the most distinctive cuts of beef enjoyed in Southern Brazil. Pairs perfectly with our homemade chimichurri sauce.
Bife com Parmesão **
GF
This Parmesan sirloin steak is unique to Rodizio Grill. It is lean, tender and topped with fresh Parmesan cheese.
Picanha **
GF
This top sirloin (beef top sirloin cap, sirloin cap, sirloin culotte) is our signature cut, specially trimmed and prepared to assure final product perfection.
Bife Com Alho **
GF
Bife com Alho is a tender cut of beef basted with our traditional house garlic rub. Our Rodizio gauchos baste the beef with a special garlic butter recipe that infuses garlic flavor into the beef. When you bite into Bife com Alho, you can taste a delicate, not overwhelming, garlic flavor.
Chef's Special **
GF
Several meats and other local selections are served as Rodizio Grill Chef's Special items and are not available at all locations at all times. Please contact your local Rodizio Grill for current Chef's Specials.
Poultry
Frango Com Bacon
GF
Frango com Bacon, chicken wrapped in bacon, is a Rodizio Grill guest and staff favorite. Tender, juicy chicken breast is wrapped in savory bacon and grilled to perfection.
Galeto
GF
Galeto is our slow-roasted, bone-in chicken thigh. Marinated  overnight in wine and a special fresh herb blend (Vinha d'alho), this grilled feature boasts crispy savory outside, and perfectly tender meat inside.
Frango Agri-Doce
GF
Rodizio Grill puts a spin on the traditional churrasco with this crowd pleasing sweet and spicy chicken.  Frango Agri-Doce was created in the kitchens of Rodizio Grill to attend to guests requests for a flavorful chicken option. The chicken is basted in Rodizio Grill's unique home-made gaucho sauce, then grilled to bring out the flavors.
Coração de Frango Temperado
GF
Coração de Frango Temperado is one of Brazil's favorite ""Churrasco"" appetizers.
Chicken hearts were traditionally found gracing in the first ""Churrascarias"" in southern Brazil. Chicken hearts, though different in texture, are very flavorful.
Pork
Linguiça
GF
Linguiça a very mild and flavorful Brazilian sausage. With a special MSG free Rodizio Grill recipe, this sausage is great right off the grill or as part of our Feijoada, our traditional Brazilian black bean stew found in the hot dishes section of our gourmet salad bar.
Pernil
GF
This flavorful selection of Berkshire Pork is lightly salted and perfectly grilled. Served with fresh lime wedges.
Presunto
GF
Rodizio Grill's Presunto is one of our signature grilled items. A lean cut of ham that is trimmed and grilled flawlessly to perfection then basted in our signature raw sugar glaze. Presunto is best accompanied with a piece of our signature grilled glazed pineapple, but it’s also good by itself.
Lamb

Cordeiro
GF
This new mint lamb is marinated in garlic, white wine, mint, lemon, and a fresh herbal blend.
Fish/Seafood

Fish/Seafood

Reviews
My company hosted a team happy hour here with the help of their Events Manager Cherish. It was a great experience from beginning to end!I have not been here in a few years and was very impressed with the upgrades made. The drinks and food were great and my team enjoyed the experience and attention to details.If you are in a need of a space for a company event, Cherish will make sure it is a flawless experience.
- Janelle S. (MIA)
This is a great event venue! Cherish, the events manager, was amazing. She helped plan and host my business launch party. Planning the event was so easy and fun and the event went better than I could’ve hoped. Highly recommend booking your events here!
- Salma M. (MIA)
My friends and I visited Blue Martini two weekends ago during my bachelorette weekend. The staff were so friendly and accommodating, we ended up staying the whole night. The environment and music were great too! Will definitely be coming back here anytime I’m in Miami. Thank you for the amazing hospitality - A soon to be bride and her Texas girls
- Maria V. (MIA)
We randomly stumbled in here and had a great time. We had a party of 15 and were able to get drinks immediately. We didn’t think we would stay so we didn’t do bottle service, then we ended up staying 3 hours and did it anyway.  The DJ was killing it! He played every genre and a little something for everyone.
- Angeli P. (MIA)
Blue Martini Brickell was recently remodeled and just reopened not too long ago. This classy venue is on track to become a top night life destination in Miami with it's impressive world-class sound system and service for the elite and chic crowd.

What Our Customers are Saying
“Try the chicken gyro!
I stopped by on a business trip and it was delicious. The prices were good, and the chicken makes your mouth water from the second you walk through the doors.
The inside is inviting and cozy, with plenty of seating. There are plenty of options, but I’ve only tried the gyro. It was delicious and filling!
If you’re in the area, give it a try.”
QuinnA87
“Excellent
We were looking for something other than a sandwich and fast food! This hit the spot! We order the family meal of a whole rotisserie chicken the cake with 3 sides and a 4 rolls. This was only $21. We got this to go and it was quick and more importantly delicious. I think we plan on a return visit to try other items on their extensive menu.”
JaceVB
“Great food, great price and fabulous staff!”
Christopher H Morrison
“Great Gyros!
Just had a regular gyro! It was super tasteful, I loved it, also super quick and efficient! Will definitely be back to try the other food in the menu.”
Anabellerojash
“SO WELL WORTH FINDING!
Delicious greek seasoned chicken. Tender. I had the zucchini squash and green beans. They tasted like real vegetables. The staff was friendly. It’s not an atmosphere place, however your tummy and tastebuds will be happy. The food is simple.”
amyg734
“Best food around! Love this place. Have been eating at Andreas’s place for years and still keep coming back. Try the hummus… along with everything else!!”

Q:
Is there vegan dim sum options?
A:
i wouldnt count on it. A lot of items using pork fat (even in things you that may be vegetarian) and shrimp. I mean you can eat rice paste as plain. Or there's just veggies they serve but these aren't like the other popular dim sum dishes.

This was an amazing experience with Yene Romay Ethiopian Kitchen
Amazing customer service. They are open late and we’re so accommodating. I love Ethiopian veggie plates. Thank you!
Amazing Ethiopian food every time we come. The sambusas are my favorite, but the half and half main with a veggie plate is the perfect amount to share with plenty of leftovers to take home.

Willkommen to Hollerbach’s
A Taste of Germany, A Heart Full of Hospitality
At Hollerbach’s, we’re more than a restaurant—we’re a family business
with a mission: to serve up Gemütlichkeit. That cozy, joyful feeling you
get when you’re surrounded by good food, good drink, good music, and
people who care.
Since 2001, we’ve grown from a 60-seat schnitzel spot to a whole block
of Gemütlichkeit, with our restaurant, German market, and Outfitters gift
shop. If you’ve visited all three in one day, you’ve gone Hollerblocking!
We’re still family-owned and operated, and our incredible team puts love
and unique little touches into everything we do. Whether this is your first
time or your fiftieth, we hope it feels like home.
Prost!!! from Christina Hollerbach & the whole Hollerbach’s crew

Schnitzel Bank
A History Of Schnitzel Haus Tradition: When I went to Kyllburg, Germany I had a unique opportunity to work in a small Gasthaus kitchen. One of the things that was reassured to me is that we are still “Schnitzel-ing” the right way. Hand-trimmed, cut, and pounded in the manner taught to me by Theo - who was taught by his Opa, a master butcher - our Schnitzels are then floured, egg-washed, lightly breaded, and pan fried in the same classic Wiener Art style. Guten Appetit!—Chef Pat
*Natur Art (unbreaded) or gluten-free breading available on request.

OUR TARE
tare is a core component of japanese cuisine - and every chef has their own expression. at its core, tare is a seasoned and reduced soy sauce; our complex secret recipe uses gluten-free soy as a base. the finished skewers are topped with sancho, which is a fragrant and citrusy peppercorn with a slight numbing sensation.

OUR STORY
Super Rico originally began as a food truck in 2011 in the heart of downtown Orlando. After two years of success, we established a brick & mortar location in the central business district in 2013.
Since then, we have been proud to serve our community as ambassadors of Colombia, representing the cuisine and culture to the people of Orlando, cooking traditional plates and other Colombian fare inspired by our own family recipes.

Common Questions
How long do I reheat my meals?
For Oven: (Recommended)
Pre-Heat Oven to 350 degrees for 15 minutes
Remove Film and Cover with Aluminum Foil
Place container in the oven for 10 – 15 minute (Longer if Required)
Serve
For Microwave:
Remove Film and Cover with Paper Towel
Place container in the microwave
Heat 1 1/2 to 2 minutes (Longer if Required)
Serve
These are recommendations and heating my vary based on your personal preferences.
What size are your meals? And how many servings are in a container?
We dispatched our hunger fire investigation team and the cause of this burning question, has the following outcome:
Our Senior Meals are all 8 ounces and portioned designed to extinguish your hunger fire, control and control money burn.
Do you have a minimum order amount?
The Senior Meal Plan contains 12 meals.
Do my meals have an expiration date?
Yes, because everything we cook/serve is prepared fresh and never sees a preservative. Your meals stay fresh for 7–10 days in the refrigerator. We do, however, have a disclaimer on salads. Due to the nature of greens, we shorten the shelf life to 3–4 days in the refrigerator.
Can I freeze my meals?
Absolutely. You can freeze your meals, especially if you do not intend to eat them within the 7-day “best if used by” date. That said, fresh is always the best. Please remember when heating from frozen, additional time is required from the time stated above.
Fire Dept. Meals would strongly advise against freezing meals that contain uncooked greens, like salads.
Can I heat my meals in the oven?
Not only can you heat your meals in the oven, but this is how we typically reheat our meals! Just remove the meal from the plastic container and place in an oven safe dish. We would recommend 10– 15 minutes in a preheated oven at 350 degrees. These are recommendations and heating instructions may vary based on your personal preferences.
I just received my meals and they are frozen. Why?
First, all meals are packaged refrigerated not frozen. However, if you are outside our hand delivery area, your meals were packaged with dry ice.
So during the shipping period, the dry ice will freeze the meals to ensure they come to you fresh and with no chance of being warm. We have tried all different refrigerants, which do not last with weather/heat and any chance of delays with UPS. The last thing we want are meals showing up warm or spoiled due to weather/time. If you have received meals from other companies with gel packs, we can pretty much guarantee they were frozen when they went in the box.
We are required by the Department of Health and the FDA, to keep the meals at 40 degrees or below to meet all food safety guidelines.
We can assure you that your meals are made fresh just a day or sometimes a few hours before going out the door. Just take the meals, place them in the fridge and they will be perfectly fresh to enjoy.
UPS just delivered our meals and they are damaged.
First, we are truly sorry that this has happened. As much as we stress our concerns with UPS management there is not much we can do.
We personally take your package (with extreme care) to the UPS facility, were it is handed over and into their care. Beyond that we have no control of what happens next and therefore can not be financially responsible for any damage.
Please make your claim with UPS and if you do happen to need any information from us, to assist in recovering your loss,  we are more than willing to provide the information (if available).

GET BAKED — NOT FRIED
It all started with a simple idea: keep the taste but ditch the grease. That’s why you won’t find a single fryer in our restaurant. So get ready to take a trip to a place where everything is baked — not fried. That’s why we say “Get Baked” and enjoy the trip. No passport required!
