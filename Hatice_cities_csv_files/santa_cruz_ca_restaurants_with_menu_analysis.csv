Braddah Timmy H.
Business Owner
We specialize in Hawaiian style plate lunch. Island recipes, and aloha straight from the aloha state of Hawai'i. Local Maui boy Braddah Timmy brings his own 'Ohana's (family) recipes along with over 20 plus years of experience in restaurant and hospitality to bring you the best Hawaiian style food you can find on the mainland! What is Plate Lunch? It is the product many cultures cuisines blended together over the span of a hundred fifty plus years of Hawaiian history during the plantation era. Different cultures came together to work in the sugar cane fields and with them they brought their countries cuisine. Eventually food carts and mom and pop shops would emerge to serve mixed plate blending each countries foods together known today as plate lunch. We hope you enjoy our Ohana's recipes and the aloha we serve in every bite.  Mahalo nui loa,

Q:
Can I get one of the sandwiches without the egg?  Maybe put the fried egg on the side?  I've heard the fried chicken is very good, but I personally don't care for eggs on my burger or fried chicken.
A:
I don't like fried egg. They have no problems accommodating my requests.

Compliance status
We firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone, and are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience,
regardless of circumstance and ability.
To fulfill this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level.
These guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible
to all people: blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more.
This website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific
disabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs.
Additionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly. This application remediates the website’s HTML,
adapts Its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by the blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments.
If you’ve found a malfunction or have ideas for improvement, we’ll be happy to hear from you. You can reach out to the website’s operators by using the following email
Screen-reader and keyboard navigation
Our website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various different behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with
screen-readers are able to read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive
a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements,
alongside console screenshots of code examples:
Screen-reader optimization:
we run a background process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website.
	In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels;
	descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups),
	and others. Additionally, the background process scans all the website’s images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag
	for images that are not described. It will also extract texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology.
	To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on
	as soon as they enter the website.
These adjustments are compatible with all popular screen readers, including JAWS and NVDA.
Keyboard navigation optimization:
The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML, and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any time by clicking Alt+1, or as the first elements of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allow the focus drift outside it.
Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements.
Disability profiles supported in our website
Epilepsy Safe Mode:
this profile enables people with epilepsy to use the website safely by eliminating the risk of seizures that result from flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations.
Visually Impaired Mode:
this mode adjusts the website for the convenience of users with visual impairments such as Degrading Eyesight, Tunnel Vision, Cataract, Glaucoma, and others.
Cognitive Disability Mode:
this mode provides different assistive options to help users with cognitive impairments such as Dyslexia, Autism, CVA, and others, to focus on the essential elements of the website more easily.
ADHD Friendly Mode:
this mode helps users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders to read, browse, and focus on the main website elements more easily while significantly reducing distractions.
Blindness Mode:
this mode configures the website to be compatible with screen-readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack. A screen-reader is software for blind users that is installed on a  computer and smartphone, and websites must be compatible with it.
Keyboard Navigation Profile (Motor-Impaired):
this profile enables motor-impaired persons to operate the website using the keyboard Tab, Shift+Tab, and the Enter keys. Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements.
Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments
Font adjustments –
users, can increase and decrease its size, change its family (type), adjust the spacing, alignment, line height, and more.
Color adjustments –
users can select various color contrast profiles such as light, dark, inverted, and monochrome. Additionally, users can swap color schemes of titles, texts, and backgrounds, with over seven different coloring options.
Animations –
person with epilepsy can stop all running animations with the click of a button. Animations controlled by the interface include videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions.
Content highlighting –
users can choose to emphasize important elements such as links and titles. They can also choose to highlight focused or hovered elements only.
Audio muting –
users with hearing devices may experience headaches or other issues due to automatic audio playing. This option lets users mute the entire website instantly.
Cognitive disorders –
we utilize a search engine that is linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing people with cognitive disorders to decipher meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and others.
Additional functions –
we provide users the option to change cursor color and size, use a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and many other functions.
Browser and assistive technology compatibility
We aim to support the widest array of browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible. Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS and NVDA (screen readers).
Notes, comments, and feedback
Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs. There may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible. Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating and improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies. All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility, following technological advancements. For any assistance, please reach out to

DISCOVER OUT STORY
We want to share our passion for the excellent food and great service. We cook our dishes from the freshest ingredients. We specialize in Dum Biryani, Tandoori, Desserts and much more in a warm friendly atmosphere. People visit restaurants on various
                    occasions.
Some like celebrating birthdays there, while others consider these places as the best ones for business meetings. Couples in love also go out on romantic dates there. Many individuals visit restaurants just to have a delicious
                    meal, especially those who donât like cooking. A lot of dishes are quite challenging to cook at home, without proficiency in the culinary art.

Finally found a place to satisfy my thirst for mutton biryani.. flavor and taste was really good.. best biryani I had so far here in Bay area
Priyanka C.
If you want to have Hyderabadi Dum Biryani in the Bay Area, this is the place to be!!!I tried biryani at several other restaurants and this place is cut above the rest.
Drea L.
This place just seems to do it right with all aspects of a flavorful briyani. The rice is perfectly cooked, the meat is tender and everything is perfectly seasoned.
Deepa B.
This hole in the wall restaurant has the best Hyderabadi Biryani in Bay Area. Love their cut-mirchi and chicken hariyali too.
Katie P.
Very authentic taste. One of the best biryanis you can have in Bay Area. We went to the restaurant and ordered apollo fish and mutton biryani for takeout and asked for both the dishes to be spicy. We were surprised with both quality and quantity of the
                                        dishes, will definitely come back for sure.
Robbie I.
My favorite go-to Indian Dish! Their Butter Chicken and garlic naan never disappoints and the food always makes you wanna order for more. Also, Rashna was very accommodating and straightforward.

Our Clients Say!!!
Absolutely love the food from Tiranga 47! The flavors are so rich and authentic, it feels like I'm dining in India. The butter chicken is my favorite, but everything on the menu is amazing!
Abhay Verma
This is hands down the best Indian food Iâve ever had in the States. The spices, the freshness, the aroma, the serviceâitâs all fantastic. I canât recommend Tiranga 47 enough!
Michael L.
As someone who grew up in India, I love Indian food, Iâm always skeptical about food trucks. But Tiranga 47 blew me away! The dishes are not only authentic but also remind me of home. Highly recommend it!

Jeff Kreer
OMG, Angel wings, where have you been all my life? Deep fried stuffed chicken wings with sweet and sour sauce and pickled veggies and you can pretty much eat the whole thing. It's the best food surprise I've had in a long time!! It's a good serving too, with a little curry rice on the side, it's a meal.
Carmen
Really good Americanized Thai food. The owners are wonderful people. My favorites were the pad tai and coconut shrimp. The fish cakes were also made fresh that day.
Matt D
We were pleasantly surprised with the taste of all five items we ordered (eggplant red curry, chicken noodle soup, fresh rolls, pineapple combo fried rice, and chow mein noodles). The staff was also on their game with keeping us filled with water and happy. We'll be back!
Matt Archer

MERCHANTS
Smile provides technology services to Merchants to enable Customers to place Orders, facilitates Orders with Merchants, and processes Payment Transactions on behalf of each Merchant.
Orders and Payment Transactions you make through our Service are transactions between you and the Merchant only, not with Smile or any of our affiliates.  Smile is not the seller of any product or service offered by Merchants and is not a party to any Payment Transaction facilitated through the Service.
You hereby acknowledge and understand that each Merchant is solely responsible and liable for all aspects of its own day-to-day operations and all selling, pricing, packaging, and provision of any products or services offered to its Customers through the Service.  Smile makes no representation or warranty regarding whether a Merchant holds any applicable permit, license, registration, or other credential for its business, whether representations by a Merchant are true and accurate, or whether a Merchant complies with applicable law.  Smile is not responsible for the quality of the products or services provided by Merchants.
USER ACCOUNTS
When you use the Service, you can choose whether you would like to register and create an Account.  If you create an Account, you may save your personal information to make future Orders faster and easier.  You may place Orders without creating an Account, but you will not be able to save any personal information or preferences for future Orders.
When you create an Account, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times.  Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your Account.
You are responsible for safeguarding your login information that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your login information.  You agree not to disclose your login information to any third party.  You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account.
APPLICATION
The Application enables you to place Orders with Merchants.  In order to use the Application, you must download the Application to your device.  Smile does not warrant that the Application will be compatible with your device.  You may use data in connection with the Application and incur additional charges from your wireless provider for the Service.  You agree that you are solely responsible for such charges.  Smile hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Application for one Account on a device owned or leased by you, for your personal use.
PLACING ORDERS FOR PRODUCTS
Your Information
If you wish to place an Order for Products available on the Service, you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Order, including, without limitation, your name, email, phone number, credit card number, credit card expiration date, your billing address, and delivery information.
You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit or debit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with your Order; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.  By submitting such information, you grant us the right to provide the information to payment processing third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of your Order.
Order
Smile makes available the Service and, either directly or through a third-party service provider, processes your Payment Transactions for your Orders on behalf of Merchants through the payment networks.  When you make an Order, you authorize Smile, as agent for the Merchant, to submit the charge in the amount of the Order (including any gratuities, fees and taxes) to your Payment Method issuer as well as any credits in connection with chargebacks, reversals, refunds or adjustments.  Smile, as the agent of the Merchant, will assist the Merchant in submitting the Payment Transaction to the payment network and processing the Payment Transaction.  Upon either Smile or a third-party service provider receiving the proceeds of the transaction, your payment obligation to the Merchant will be deemed completed (except in the case of a later chargeback or reversal).
You must provide a valid Payment Method to pay for your Order made through any of the Service.  You authorize Smile to confirm your Payment Method is in good standing with the issuing financial institution.  You agree that Smile, on behalf of the Merchant, may resubmit a Payment Transaction for processing to a payment network in the event a prior Payment Transaction was declined or returned.
If you choose to store Payment Method information with Smile via the Service for your convenience and use in future transactions, you agree that Smile may receive up-to-date information on your Payment Method information (such as card number or expiration date) through services available from the card networks and may update your Payment Method credentials stored with Smile (if you choose to store your Payment Method credentials) from time to time.
We may establish limitations concerning use of the Service, including without limitation, individual or aggregate transaction limits on the dollar amount or number of Payment Transactions you may make within certain time periods.  We may decline to process any Payment Transaction without any notice to you.  We may delay processing of or hold or cancel processing of any Payment Transaction upon the direction of the Merchant or if we believe, in our sole discretion, that the transaction is invalid, suspicious, involves misconduct or fraud, or otherwise violates applicable law and rules, these Terms and Conditions, or any other policies. Payments made through the Service are also subject to the terms of your agreement with your Payment Method issuer.  You are solely responsible for any charges or fees that may be imposed by your Payment Method issuer as a result of using the Service.
Order Changes, Cancellation, and Refunds
Merchants each set their own cancellation and refund policies.  Once an Order has been made through the Service, you will need to contact the Merchant directly to inquire if you can make a change to or cancel the Order or whether you may receive a refund.
You authorize Smile to communicate with the Merchant regarding the change or cancellation of your Order.  Reimbursement will be made upon confirmation by Smile that the change or cancellation of your Order can be made.  We will use the same means of payment as you used for the Order.
For questions or customer service regarding an Order or the product or service provided by a Merchant, please contact the Merchant directly.  Smile is not responsible for any Merchant product or service issues or content errors or inaccuracies related to a Merchant’s website, menu, or other materials.
Smile reserves the right to refuse or cancel your Order at any time for certain reasons, including the following:
There is an error in your Order.
Fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.
Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies
Merchants may update their Products, including their prices, from time to time.  The Products available on our Service may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable, and we may experience delays in updating information regarding the Products on the Service and other websites.
Smile cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information of the Products, including their prices, images, specifications and availability, and Merchants’ services.  We reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions on the Service at any time without prior notice.
Payments
All Products purchased are subject to a one-time payment.  Payment can be made through various payment methods we have available, such as Visa and MasterCard.
Payment cards (credit cards or debit cards) are subject to validation checks and authorization by your card issuer.  If we do not receive the required authorization, we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery of your Order.
Shipping and Delivery
Product shipping, delivery, and preparation timelines are estimated by each Merchant.  Merchants and their shipping or delivery service providers, where applicable, are responsible for ensuring that appropriate insurance policies are in place for the shipping and delivery of the Products to Customers.  Smile will not be responsible for any damage caused to Products during shipping or delivery or any loss or damage caused in connection with the supply of Products.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The Service and its original contents (excluding contents provided by you or other users), features and functionality (including derivative works, modifications, and additions thereto) are and will remain the exclusive property of Smile and its licensors.  The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other applicable laws.
Our intellectual property, including copyright and trademark, may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of Smile.
YOUR FEEDBACK TO US
You assign all rights, title and interest in any Feedback you provide Smile.  If for any reason such assignment is ineffective, you agree to grant Smile a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free, worldwide right and license to use, reproduce, disclose, sub-license, distribute, modify and exploit such Feedback without restriction.
LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES
Our Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Smile.  Smile has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.  You further acknowledge and agree that Smile shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such websites or services.  We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party websites or services that you visit.
TERMINATION
We may limit, suspend, or terminate your Account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation, if you breach these Terms and Conditions.  Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately.  If you wish to terminate your Account, you may simply discontinue using the Service or send an email to
[email protected]
requesting to terminate your Account.
Termination of your Account does not relieve you of the obligation to pay for any Orders made as well as related fees and charges already incurred.  In the event of closure of your Account, we will not provide any refunds for amounts previously paid through the Service.
In certain cases, we may not allow you to close your Account, including but not limited to:
to evade an investigation;
you have open or pending Orders or Payment Transactions; or
if you owe money to Smile or a Merchant due to your use of the Service.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of Smile and any of its suppliers under any provision of these Terms and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you through the Service.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Smile or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, or business interruption, arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software, and/or third-party hardware used with the Service or otherwise in connection with any provision of these Terms), even if Smile or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability for certain kinds of damages, so some of these limitations may not apply to you.  In such a case, Smile's liability will be limited to the minimum amount enforceable under applicable law.
“AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” DISCLAIMER
The Service is provided to you “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” and with all faults and defects, if any, without warranty of any kind.  To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, Smile, on its own behalf and on behalf of its respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice.  Without limitation to the foregoing, Smile provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.  Without limiting the foregoing, neither Smile nor any of Smile's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of Smile are free of malware or other harmful components.
Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is done at your own discretion and risk and you are solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or device or loss of data that results from the download of any such material.  No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from Smile or a third party through or from the Service will create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some of the above exclusions or limitations may not apply to you.  In such a case, the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the minimum extent required by law.
FORCE MAJEURE
Smile will not be liable for any failure or delay resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to governmental action or acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, pandemic, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, and Internet disturbances.
GOVERNING LAW
The laws of the State of Washington govern these Terms and your use of the Service without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
SEVERABILITY AND WAIVER
Severability
If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
Waiver
Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
TRANSLATION INTERPRETATION
These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if we have made them available to you on our Service.  You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.
CHANGES TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time.  If a revision is material, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide, in a reasonable time and manner (including email), any new terms taking effect.  What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

Chelsea & Tram
THE TWO OF US
Mariposa opened last fall, but the idea began percolating years earlier. Cabrera grew up in Miami and dreamed of starting a vegan Cuban food truck before pursuing a nursing career that eventually brought her to Santa Cruz. Vu, a native of San Jose, dove into the food industry at age 15. She eventually moved to Santa Cruz and opened The Sandwich Spot in the space that eight years later would become Mariposa.
“Growing up, I drank a lot of Vietnamese coffee, but I always heard that Cuban coffee was the strongest, so when I met Chelsea, I had to try it,” says Vu. “We would go camping and Chelsea would make the coffee, and I would wake up to the smell of espresso in the air. That’s when we realized this was something special and the idea was born. Let’s put two of the strongest coffees together under the same roof.”

Important Note :
At McDonald's, we take great care to serve quality, great-tasting menu items to our customers each and every time they visit our restaurants. We understand that each of our customers has individual needs and considerations when choosing a place to eat or drink outside their home, especially those customers with food allergies. As part of our commitment to you, we provide the most current ingredient information available from our food suppliers for the nine most common allergens as identified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (eggs, dairy, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish and sesame), so that our guests with food allergies can make informed food selections. However, we also want you to know that despite taking precautions, normal kitchen operations may involve some shared cooking and preparation areas, equipment and utensils, and the possibility exists for your food items to come in contact with other food products, including allergens. We encourage our customers with food allergies or special dietary needs to visit www.mcdonalds.com for ingredient information, and to consult their doctor for questions regarding their diet. If you have questions about our food, please reach out to us directly using our
contact us forms

Percent Daily Values (DV) and RDIs are based on unrounded values.
**
Percent Daily Values (DV) are based on a 2,000 calorie diet. Your daily values may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs.
The nutrition information on this website is derived from testing conducted in accredited laboratories, published resources, or from information provided from McDonald's suppliers. The nutrition information is based on standard product formulations and serving sizes.  Calories for fountain beverages are based on standard fill levels plus ice. If you use the self-service fountain inside the restaurant for your drink order, see the sign posted at the beverage fountain for beverage calories without ice. All nutrition information is based on average values for ingredients and is rounded in accordance with current U.S. FDA NLEA regulations. Variation in serving sizes, preparation techniques, product testing and sources of supply, as well as regional and seasonal differences may affect the nutrition values for each product. In addition, product formulations change periodically. You should expect some variation in the nutrient content of the products purchased in our restaurants. Beverage sizes may vary in your market. McDonald’s USA does not certify or claim any of its US menu items as Halal, Kosher or meeting any other religious requirements. We do not promote any of our US menu items as vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free. This information is correct as of January 2022, unless stated otherwise.

HERITAGE DUROC PORK CHOP
16 oz. All-natural, thick cut from rib of loin, high level of marbling
Partnered with Chicago’s Allen Bros. a premier purveyor of fine beef since 1893, we exclusively feature their finest hand-cut selections of
steaks and chops. All of our beef is corn-fed, rated USDA Prime and solely sourced from Midwestern Native Beef farms in Nebraska, Iowa,
Kansas and Colorado. To achieve a tender, flavorful meat our steaks have been “wet-aged” under highly controlled conditions for 32-48 days.
Only 2% of all beef produced has been allocated to be certified as USDA Prime.
DRY-AGED USDA PRIME MIDWEST BEEF
Dry-aged a minimum of 30 days under highly controlled conditions allows natural enzymes to tenderize the meat, deepens the beef’s
nuanced flavor while imparting a rich taste with a sweet nuttiness reminiscent of roasted peanuts. The longer aging time increases
moisture evaporation creating a texture with a bit more bite than what you would expect from a wet-aged steak, we also
recommend cooking to a rare or medium-rare to maintain the delicate flavor profile.

Compliance status
We firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone, and are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience,
regardless of circumstance and ability.
To fulfill this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level.
These guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities. Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible
to all people: blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more.
This website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times. We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific
disabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs.
Additionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly. This application remediates the website’s HTML,
adapts Its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by the blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments.
If you’ve found a malfunction or have ideas for improvement, we’ll be happy to hear from you. You can reach out to the website’s operators by using the following email
Screen-reader and keyboard navigation
Our website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various different behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with
screen-readers are able to read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions. As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive
a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively. Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements,
alongside console screenshots of code examples:
Screen-reader optimization:
we run a background process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website.
	In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes. For example, we provide accurate form labels;
	descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups),
	and others. Additionally, the background process scans all the website’s images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag
	for images that are not described. It will also extract texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology.
	To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on
	as soon as they enter the website.
These adjustments are compatible with all popular screen readers, including JAWS and NVDA.
Keyboard navigation optimization:
The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML, and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any time by clicking Alt+1, or as the first elements of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allow the focus drift outside it.
Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements.

Q:
Is it easy to find parking near the restaurant?
A:
Prepare to park 2-3 blocks away. However, street parking availability depends on time of day. It's harder to find parking in the evenings/at night. I prefer ride share transportation (Lyft, Uber) if I go downtown in the evening.

Q:
Do they still charge 15% service charge when dining in?
Is so, is it disclosed on the menu or on the bill?
A:
As of Jan 3, 2024. The signage for 18% is still there. Looks like the restaurant wont understand until they go out of business. They need to change their policy to charge service tax for 5 or more people.

About the Business
Pana Venezuelan Food in downtown Santa Cruz brings the bold, comforting flavors of Venezuela to the heart of California. Founded by German and Gabriela, Pana specializes in authentic arepas—crispy cornmeal pockets filled with traditional ingredients like shredded beef, chicken with avocado, black beans, cheese, and more. Each arepa is 100% gluten-free and made fresh to order with care and flavor that reflects home-cooked roots. But Pana is more than just arepas. The menu includes tropical juices like papaya and watermelon, savory yuca fries, sweet plantains, and the crowd-favorite dessert: quesillo, a creamy Venezuelan flan. What makes Pana truly unique is the heart behind the food. Every guest is treated like family, and the team works with customers’ needs and budgets, especially for catering and events. Whether you’re grabbing lunch downtown or planning a party, Pana brings real hospitality, bold flavors, and cultural pride to every plate. It's not just a meal—it's a taste of Venezuela.
