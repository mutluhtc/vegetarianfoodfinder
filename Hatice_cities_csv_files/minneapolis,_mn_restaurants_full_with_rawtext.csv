Business owner information
Broder Family B.
Business Owner
Located across the street from our original deli, Broders' Cucina Italiana, Broders' Pasta Bar has taken the art of fresh pasta one step further. While the Cucina sells pasta to customers who want to cook at home, the pasta bar was designed to delight our customers with pasta cooked the way it is meant to be. Each of the 22 or so pasta and risotto on the menu are cooked to order and served steaming hot. Those seated at the bar get the best view of our pasta chefs cooking their dish, which is always 'al dente' and carefully tossed.
This is not a pasta restaurant that ladles on white or red sauce nor is it a chain. Each dish gets an individual sauté of the highest quality fresh ingredients. Great care is taken in the daily production of our fine egg pasta which is also sold to cook at home in our deli across the street. Our menu changes seasonally and there are always daily specials.

Q:
Is the linguine made fresh at Broder's Pasta Bar?  Just ate there and I would guess not.
A:
Since it is not listed in the menu as either ""Egg"" or ""Eggless"", I believe that means its dried pasta. To be sure, you'd have to call them directly.

Q:
Is It a reasonably quiet restaurant for a luncheon gathering for a group 5 to 10 people?
A:
Yes I was there for lunch. A business lunch of approximately 10 people came in. It was perfect. I could barely hear them. The restaurant was quiet for them as well.

PIZZA
PIZZA
Everything that goes into our pizzas is the best it can be. Our dough is made from scratch and hand-kneaded to create each crust. We use only select california tomatoes, blended with our secret italian herbs and spices, to create our satisfyingly robust pizza sauce. Even the mozzarella cheese that tops our pizzas is special. It comes from a small, independent cheese maker. And if you order sausage on your pizza, it will be the same home-made italian sausage that’s been making the Cossetta name famous since 1911.
You simply can’t order a tastier, more authentic italian style pizza anywhere in the world.

Heritage Wheat
Menu
Our family’s time around the table inspires us each day to create memorable dishes that reflect our philosophy of honest, simple, Italian cooking and dedication to quality ingredients. Our a la carte menu offers a variety of traditional dishes as well as international flavors using products we find inspiring. Whenever possible, we choose local/organic producers who choose sustainable methods. As a FishSmart partner, we are committed to offering sustainably sourced seafoods from wild caught Pacific fish to organically farm raised salmon, we also serve Lake Superior Whitefish in season. Our meats come from regional coops and our fresh pastas are made in house by our second generation pasta chef. We pride ourselves on using whole ingredients and slow cooking techniques that reflect quality and expertise.
No microwave in our Italian kitchen.
We are very fortunate to work with Sandra Jean Herbal Specialties and have done so since opening Luci Ancora in 1997. Her farm, located outside of French Lake, Minnesota supplies our kitchens with fresh produce, herbs, flowers, and eggs raised using chemical free methods that work in harmony with nature.
Because we are a scratch kitchen, we are generally able to accommodate a variety of diets.
We are pleased to report that Luci now has a full bar. Come in and check it out!

We’re that little hole-in-the-wall pizza joint that’s been there forever. It’s the place your grandparents and parents remember and love. It’s the place you take your kids. It’s that place that was on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives. It’s that place where people from out of town always want to go. That’s what 46 years of creating homemade food, serving generous portions at fair prices and serving it all with a little laughter gets you. It’s a reputation. And we’re proud of it.
Give a gift they'll never get fed up with.
Donatelli's gift cards are always the perfect size and color.

MENU
We prioritize purchasing from Indigenous food producers locally and nationally. We have removed colonial ingredients such as wheat flour, cane sugar and dairy. We are proud to present a decolonized dining experience.

DRINKS

WINE + BEER
We choose to support and purchase from BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color), non-binary and femme-identifying producers for our alcoholic beverages. We are honored to present a primarily Indigenous-produced wine list featuring selections from native winemakers in California, Mexico's Valle de Guadalupe, and Mãori wines from New Zealand.
We source and elevate selections crafted by BIPOC producers in a largely non-diverse and privileged industry.

OUR PHILOSOPHY
AT OWAMNI WE LOOK AT THE WORLD THROUGH A DECOLONIZED LENS
- WHICH TO US, IS SIMPLE.
The Indigenous perspective on the history of America is to acknowledge the centuries of intense violence, forced assimilation, segregation and cultural erasure that has happened to our cultures and communities.
We reject the values that have been upheld by settler colonialism, such as the wanton destruction of environment, including mining, logging, and monoculture agriculture, all of which contribute to the enrichment of a select few while our beautiful Indigenous landscapes and the people who have traditionally lived on them and are continually abused.
The goal of this restaurant is to showcase modern Indigenous foods. This means that we prioritize purchasing from Indigenous producers first, and build our seasonal menus to reflect region, culture, and Indigenous food identities. Our menu reflects the work of our non-profit North American Traditional Indigenous Food Systems (NÃTIFS).
We have cut out colonial ingredients such as beef, pork, chicken, dairy, wheat flower and cane sugar, instead highlighting true agricultural products of North America, such as corns, beans, squash, wild game, birds, fish and Native plants.
This approach offers a different story of American cooking than the Eurocentric one that is traditionally touted - instead celebrating the amazing Indigenous diversity of Turtle Island.
We hope you enjoy and Thank You for supporting our missing and vision!

Fresh Ingredients
Following our
Triple Green Strategy
Triple Green Strategy
By keeping our ingredient sourcing local we are ensuring that our process benefits both our customers and the local communities that grow our ingredients. We do this through being more selective (fresher ingredients), sourcing local (reducing environmental impact), and buying local (keeping more money in local communities).
Ingredient quality matters and that’s why we chose to source locally from small farms in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Kado no Mise, translating to “Corner Restaurant,” serves Edomae sushi and simple, delicate Japanese fare, true to the tastes and form that Chef Furukawa learned when he first started cooking professionally in his hometown of Tokyo.
We are now accepting reservations for our omakase prix-fixe tasting menu at our second floor chef’s counter and in our second floor dining room Wednesday-Sunday.
We are offering three set omakase menus:
“ume”
(84/pp),
“take”
(138/pp), and
“matsu”
(192/pp). At the counter, only “take” and “matsu” are available. Our seating times are 5:30/5:45 and 8:00/8:15. Prices reflect an included 21% service charge.
Omakase, which translates to “I’ll leave it up to you,” is a dining experience in which you leave your evening in the hands of the sushi chef, who orchestrates a highly-curated sequence of dishes. The omakase experience involves an element of surrender and trust, but that trust is rewarded with a diversity of flavors and the best that our restaurant has to offer.
Make your reservation for our omakase tasting menu using the button below.
Cancellation Policy
Your reservation can be canceled at any time before the time of the reservation should your plans change. However, we request that you do so at least 48 hours in advance so Kado no Mise can plan accordingly. Deposits are refundable up to 48 hours before a reservation.

AWARD-WINNING PIZZA
A LOCAL LEGEND WITH DEEP ROOTS
A legend has to start somewhere, right? Ours began in St. Paul, MN in 1935. For forty years Green Mill was a neighborhood staple and it’s still the oldest licensed pub in St. Paul. On a trip to Chicago in 1975, Green Mill’s owners fell in love with deep dish pizza and added their version to the menu. What happened next was pizza history. Word spread. Lines formed. Awards were won. A legend was born. Soon pizza lovers throughout the upper Midwest could visit their own local Green Mill for a slice of history. The menu grew too and so did our pizza delivery options. And our made-from-scratch pasta, sandwiches, and hand-crafted cocktails became fan favorites.
At
Green Mill
, we’re proud of our neighborhood roots. It may have started with deep-dish pizza, but it’s our deep commitment to quality food, genuine service, and our guests that keep the Green Mill legend growing.

A note about allergens:
We do our best to offer dishes that can accommodate most major allergy concerns either naturally or with some substitutions/omissions, and our kitchen crew works diligently to avoid any cross-contamination. However, because our housemade peanut butter truly is made in-house every day, we cannot guarantee a kitchen free from peanut dust particles and therefore cannot promise the same level of safety for those with severe peanut allergies. All items marked ""Gluten Free"" should be considered Gluten-free-friendly (or can be prepared gluten-free-friendly with minor omissions). This is NOT a GF-certified facility. If you have any allergen or menu questions, please contact us at TalkToUs@HellsKitchenInc.com or ask your server upon arrival.

7.3% ABV | Blackberry, raspberry & lemon sour aged with Brettanomyces to deliver a delightfully dry and tart-forward fruited sour full of berry and citrus flavors and aromas
Hiding Place (Barrel-Aged Sour) - Indeed - $30
7.1% ABV | Currant and raspberry sour ale aged on oak.  Rich and round fruit aromas  with an assertive sour kick and long-lasting berry flavors.  Complex and funky, this fruity sour is only slightly-sweet with an assertive tannic dryness that begs for another sip
Kinda Blue (Barrel-Aged Sour) - Indeed - $30
6.5% ABV | Blueberry/Brett sour aged in oak barrels.  Soft aromas of blueberry play with Brett-derived pineapple and hay notes.  An assertive dryness whisks away a mouthful of tart blueberry to deliver a nuanced sour worth sharing with friends OR hoarding to yourself because you deserve it!

Marisa P:
I went here for the first time today and it was AMAZING! I got three authentic tacos, barbacoa, carnitas, and chicken tinga. The meat was flavorful and juicy. With everything being take out right now, these held up very well on my drive home. The corn tortillas didn't tear and the tacos didn't fall apart...
Review by - Yelp
Toni R:
This place is amazing. EVERY time me come the food is perfect. Just delicious. And the service is just as good. Keep up the good work!!  We are from out of town and go out of our way to hit this place up whenever we are close. Thank you!!

Lori S:
Picked up to-go from this place yesterday. I ordered Barbacoa flauta and it was AMAZING! Beans and rice are on point. I also ordered a carnitas burrito which I ate today. It was also amazing! Loved the flavor of each of the meat choices. Really delicious and I will order from them again.
Review by - Yelp
Mike C:
Drove past this place several times without realizing it it existed The reason for five stars is because the food is consistent and authentic. Plus there is no competition around with this authenticity and you would have to go all the way to Lake Street to get Mexican food of this quality...
Review by - Yelp
Sydney N:
I love going here with my boyfriend- I always get the carne asada traditional tacos with elite & a mango soda. The environment is very nice and pretty. I will always come back because this is one of my favorite taco places. Employees are very nice. Sometimes other customers are so impatient and unforgiving, but I've never had an issue with any service there. They are GREAT!

Premium Ingredients.
Endless Choice.
Your choice to add toppings to any meal, like sautéed veggies, sour cream, jalapeños, and more. If gluten isn’t in your diet, skip our tortillas. If you’re highly sensitive to gluten, we’ll gladly change our gloves for you. You should be aware that some items containing corn, including our blue corn tortilla chips and corn salsa, may have a small amount of gluten from potentially co-mingling with gluten-containing grains in crop fields.

Q:
Is any of the meat halal here thanks?
A:
According to the Cafe itself, they do NOT serve halal food. At least that would apply to the meats. I am not sure if that status also extends to their vegetarian or vegan dishes.

Reviews
First time customer (takeout). Writing this while eating. It’s that good. Someone took some pride in making our dishes tonight. Very fresh, distinctive, and delicious.
Bryan Mack
Authentic Chinese cuisine at a very affordable price. We have visited this place many times, and the staff has always been very friendly to us. Highly recommended.
Falina
We ordered dumplings, kung pao chicken, shrimp fried rice, and beef fried noodles (lo mein). Every dish was fantastic! We were impressed with the quality of the food.
Ashlyn Lor
Amazing hole in the wall Chinese restaurant focusing on northern Chinese food. I often ask the server for a recommendation and he always has good suggestions.
Luca Rescigno
AMAZING place! Been here several times and have tried something new each time, and whatever I order has always been delicious. Hands down my favorite Chinese restaurant.
Jen
The staff was very friendly and attentive And we felt very well attended to. The food was excellent. Each dish was absolutely delicious. Definitely worthy of 5 stars.

Q:
At this location, is it all hot pot or can you order off a regular menu?  In any case, I was there before the remodel & am interested in trying it again.
A:
Dear Brian, thanks for asking. Sorry for the delay. We are an hot pot restaurant now. You can either do the $28.99 all-you-can-eat ($11.99 for kids 12 and under), or order off a hot pot menu. Looking forward to serving you.

Q:
Is this place all you can eat and estimated price for the all you can eat? how's the service as well?
A:
$28.99/ person AUCE. They bring out a paper menu for your group and you mark what foods you would like and they bring it out to you. Food was good overall. I would say service is 5/10. They didn't really explain anything, brought out plates…

What Diners are Saying
“
This restaurant has a beautiful interior with fun designs and murals on the wall. We had ordered pork mini buns, Lanzhou Beef Noodle Soup, and the Golden Sliced Beef Noodle Soup. They were both delicious- with a bit of chili oil added it was perfect. The service was fantastic and I hope to come back soon to try more!
“
“This is a yummy new spot for us to enjoy!
Try the fried noodles. That was our favorite dish. We also loved the scallion pancake. It was nice and crisp and had a light/non-greasy flavor. We found the whole experience enjoyable. The friendly staff and very clean environment will have us back again as well.”
“Very clean and well decorated.
We ordered the Chongqing spicy noodle and the garlic beef fried noodles. Both dishes were flavorful and delicious. The beef was tender and juicy. The noodles are noticeable in-house made. The chili oil is also worth mentioning and is essential to your dish. I will definitely be coming back!”
“Master Noodle is a gem! Their hand pulled/cut noodles are unique and delicious, unlike anything else in the area. The prices are right, the service is superb, and the serving size filling. Definitely worth it! 😋”

Reviews
Such a fun environment for brunch! It keeps you covid safe and compliant while also letting you interact from afar with nearby patrons (from the safety of your own table). The food is delicious, and the staff is so kind. I would absolutely call this a can't miss!
Chris Fry
This spot is worth giving a shot. They serve big portions for convenient rates. Always well organized and with great mood. Would recommend to others.
Todd Lauber
I was surprised to see food spanning from sushi to ""India curry"" to ""Thai curry"" but everything was great! Good prices and great service. The patio was nice too. The waitress was very informed on which options were vegan.
Kelsey Mullins
Truly great sushi. Everlyn is an amazing server and very kind! We realized we were eating the freshest sushi we have ever had, and we’re very happy about this; right in our backyard too! 😁 Clean restaurant, great food, amazing service: we left satiated and very pleased.
Angela No
The best sushi in the twin cities is Sukura's down town St. Paul. Miyabi is a very close second! Delicious!! Would definitely recommend to all.
Chris
Everything was amazing!  But really out of this world appetizer. Tempura shrimp and veggies🤤Mango mojito was delicious and Ramune for the kiddos and tempura ice cream for dessert.  Fabulous dinner.  Can't wait to go again!

Q:
Is there a lunch buffet?
A:
I wish there was, but there doesn't appear to be. They have a huge lunch crowd from 3M everyday so I guess they figured they didn't need one.

Aja Dressler
The staff was so kind and considerate, they made sure to help us decide what to order, and helped explain how to cook their hotpot. We ordered the pork belly, stir fry tofu, and Sichuan hot pot + more hot pot a la carte. The food was delicious and fresh despite us coming in around closing, and was bursting with
...
flavor! Bathrooms were clean and tidy, as were the tables. Overall, an amazing experience with attentive staff and flavorful dishes! Would recommend and will definitely come again soon!!

Stumbled upon this place by accident while looking for some late night noodles for date night around 8:30pm. Every other place closed at 9pm except this place (which was open until 11pm).so we decided to give it a try... boy oh boy are we glad we did! My husband was a tad nervous about how to cook the hot pot as this
...
was his first time having this type of entrÃ©e. A wonderful woman (who worked there) noticed his confusion, came over and walked him through it step by step. She was kind, funny and made us feel comfortable and at home. Our waitress was also phenomenal in helping with recommendations about the menu, she was sweet, respectful and relatable.  The atmosphere was amazing (relaxing, clean with an upscale feel).
We thought we were going to pay an arm and a leg but everything was very affordable! We even got to enjoy late night happy hour! Not only was the staff, atmosphere and price fabulous but the food and experience was FANTASTIC! My husband and myself agreed that the coconut creampuffs were the best we have EVER had! Every item we had was fresh and flavorful! Not a single thing we didn't like. We loved everything about this place! It truly is a one of a kind rare find! We will be back multiple times. We want to try everything on the menu ð A solid 10/10 would recommend ð

Food is wonderful. Plenty of choices. Best Hot Pot in town. Individual broth pots. Delightful service. Great ambiance. Can6 wait to go back.
Darrin Salzmann
The Spicy Sichuan hot pot was exactly what I wanted, unrelenting heat and lots of flavor. All the meats and vegetables were fresh, drinks were great and service was awesome even though our server wrongfully believes LeBron is the GOAT ð
Ajah Johnson
We had an amazing time! The drinks alone were so good. Our server taught us how to eat the food correctly, and the vibes all around were amazing. We didn't eat much but what we tried was delicious. Brought the rest of the food home for dinner. Definitely a 10/10. The restaurant was also very clean and has nice decor
...
as well. Perfect for a date night.

I love the hotpot and the salt and pepper tofu here.  They are vegan friendly.  Individual hot pot you can cook at your seat.  You can enjoy you meal with non vegans without fuzz.

The herbal vegan broth is great and thereâs two other broths that can be made vegan also.

They also have a lot of options to pick from
...
the menu on what you can put in there.

So happy they opened up again.   Owner and staff are all helpful and friendly.

Canât recommend this enough.

I went there tonight for the first time. The Vietnamese hotpot was so delicious! Iâm part Vietnamese so Iâm picky  regarding Vietnamese food.
We were a group of 8 people and everyone loved their food and their delicious exotic cocktails. On top, their service was excellent! We particularly appreciated the owner and
...
his nephew.
I highly recommend this place! We will for sure go back.

The Salt & Pepper Tofu is the bomb and I highly recommend it. Itâs a carryover from the original Jasmine 26. We are so, so glad itâs still on the menu.
Jordan Dockendorf
I canât begin to say enough great things about Jasmine 26! This Eat Street restaurant is a culinary oasis that never fails to impress. From the moment you step through the door, you're greeted with warmth and hospitality that sets the tone for an unforgettable dining experience.

Upon entering, the inviting aroma of
...
simmering broths and exotic spices immediately whets the appetite. The ambiance is cozy yet vibrant, with tastefully decorated interiors that exude charm.

The service at Jasmine 26 Hot Pot is nothing short of exceptional. The attentive staff and wonderful owners go above and beyond to ensure that every guest feels pampered and attended to. From offering helpful recommendations to accommodating special requests, they truly excel in creating a memorable dining experience. My partner wasnât sure of what noodle he wanted but they brought out multiple to try so he could make a good choice.

One of the standout features of Jasmine 26 Hot Pot is the impeccable quality of their ingredients. From premium cuts of meat to fresh seafood and an array of farm-fresh vegetables, every element is carefully selected to guarantee a feast for the senses.

But what truly sets Jasmine 26 Hot Pot apart is the passion and dedication of its owners. Their genuine enthusiasm for their craft is palpable, and it reflects in every aspect of the dining experience. Not only do they ensure that every dish is prepared to perfection, but they also take the time to interact with guests, sharing stories and laughter that add an extra layer of warmth to the meal.

We went on Valentineâs Day, which also happens to be my partnerâs birthday, and even though the restaurant was packed, the quality of service and food did not diminish. This place is truly one of a kind!

As you walk in you are greeted by a friendly host, upbeat music, and a beautiful clean atmosphere. The staff are all welcoming and provide some of the best customer service I have ever experienced! If I was a manager I would have tried to recruit the young man that was our waiter! He was upbeat, always wore a smile,
...
and was very personable. Along with the wonderful atmosphere and staff, the food was absolutely incredible! I ordered the chicken wings and sticky bbq ribs, both of which had incredible and robust flavor. I couldnât speak more highly of a restaurant! Visiting Jasmine 26 is a must!

Tiffany M:
This place is amazing.. I love the staff, the atmosphere, and of course the food! This is one of my family's all time favorite place to go. It clean and the food is always good, they cook their vegetables just right, not full of oil like other places. The sushi is also fresh and so yummy..

Laotian Americans (Lao : ຄົນອາເມລິກາລາວ) are Americans who trace their ancestry to Laos. Laotian Americans are included in the larger category of Asian Americans. The major immigrant generation were generally refugees who escaped Laos during the warfare and disruption of the 1970s, and entered refugee camps in Thailand across the Mekong River. They emigrated to the United States during the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s.

The Twin Cities’ First Thai Restaurant
In 1980, Supenn Supatanasinkasem Harrison opened the first authentic Thai restaurant in the Twin Cities, which was the first in
the 5 state area. For the first time adventurous Minnesotans were introduced to this ’new’ cuisine that appealed to all the senses.
Since those early days, the norms of dining out choices have greatly expanded. Being one of the first culinary trailblazers,
Sawatdee has become an institution for the ‘definitely different’ crowd—adventurers, non-conformists & people of all types with
only one thing in common—they each march to the beat of their own drums.
Like our customers, Thai cuisine is unique & diverse— you may find that no two dishes are the same. Our offerings highlight the
aromas & distinct flavors of India, Malaysia & China. The result is distinctly Thai. While the public tends to focus on the
potential for volcanic spiciness—connoisseurs understand that the secret of Thai cooking is in the interplay between the spices &
the main ingredients, the delicate balance of spicy, sour, sweet, salty & bitter, achieved when each enhances without overpowering
the other.
Your requests are made individually to order, to your taste, from the freshest ingredients. Not all dishes need to be spicy. Be sure
to tell your server your spiciness preference. As it is done in Thailand, we serve our dishes family style in generous portions—
allowing everyone to try a little of everything if they wish. We challenge you to stray from your favorite dishes & try something
new each time you visit!

This place is absolutely amazing!  I loved every meal I've ever had here.  Nobody else even comes close!  The hot wings are fantastic, so full of flavor!

Matthew S.:
Best Asian/Thai in the area easily. Curry fried rice might be the best fried rice I've had. Red curry chicken is unbelievable, especially ordered 3x spicy or more. Vegetables and meats in stir fries are super fresh and tasty. Spring rolls are excellent and very fresh. Egg rolls here are top 3 of what I've tried.

I have no idea as bf and I were in only for the weekend but I'm thinking probably since the business has blown up since their double appearance on triple d. I will tell that they only serve beer and wine.

Best Darn TapHouse In The North
Northern Taphouse is the place you have been waiting for. A little bit of the city in our suburb.

Whether you’re out on a Monday to watch the game with the guys, or getting lunch with family on a Sunday afternoon, we’ve got a spot for you.

For the last 20 years, there’s one thing we’ve never changed— every sauce is made in-house, our chicken is fresh-cut and marinated, every veggie is freshly cut and prepped daily. We’ve spent two decades sourcing breads and meats from top-quality producers, ensuring they’re crafted to our exact proprietary recipes. At Spitz, freshness and quality aren’t just priorities—they’re our main recipe, our secret recipe, the only recipe we’ll never change.

For the last 20 years, there’s one thing we’ve never changed— every sauce is made in-house, our chicken is fresh-cut and marinated, every veggie is freshly cut and prepped daily. We’ve spent two decades sourcing breads and meats from top-quality producers, ensuring they’re crafted to our exact proprietary recipes. At Spitz, freshness and quality aren’t just priorities—they’re our main recipe, our secret recipe, the only recipe we’ll never change.

Melissa R:
We got straight off a plane and stopped here. The food was fantastic and different and inventive. The service was also great. It is a family run business and the family was working their tails off. I'm sad we don't live here so I can't have it more. Loved it all.

This was a great time and the conveyor belt style is iconic without a doubt! Our waitress was a lot of fun and extremely kind even though we didn't need to interact often. This experience is definitely on the pricier end, but that's somewhat understandable considering that it's a novelty within the city. The only things that would make this a perfect score is better ventilation within the building so that you don't leave the restaurant with your clothes smelling of fish and also by offering more preparations of sushi.

Pretty good overall, but the sushi selection is pretty limited. The sushi they do have is tasty but nothing spectacular. The service is great and very kind. I think it’s a good place to try to get a quick bite and enjoy the novelty of the train. However I think they could really improve by adding new sushi rolls to the menu.

I honestly didn't know what to think, when I first heard about it, but I was blown away! It is one of the most visually stimulating and amazing places to eat. The service was excellent and the sushi was fantastic. My taste buds actually gave me a high five at one point! Give it a try.

Such a great place to try lots of dishes. Not a fan this trip of the egg rolls. Edamame is not hot and was best I've had in a long time! The menu is mostly sushi now. They have amazing other dishes as well.

We went to a conveyor belt sushi place in Osaka, Japan a few years ago and this was a fun find right in our backyard! The food was all delicious, and we had great service from the staff. It's great to take a plate or two for ""appetizers"" as you watch the options for dinner stroll by. The time between plates helps you fill up, so you don't get too many plates and overeat! We left very content in our tummies and our wallet!

They are just getting better every time I go there. I have been there 3 times and the vegetarian options of sushi keep increasing, first time it was avocados, cucumber and avocado cucumber. Second time they added sweet potato sushi and this time, they had avocado cream cheese sushi and did I love it. Nona there has really taken the restaurant with storm with her creative ideas and vegetarian options. I will keep coming back to this place again and again. Also, as a vegetarian, I feel the pricing overall is economic for eating sushi. :)

Great to try a variety of different sushi and enjoy a fun unique experience of the sushi train. Very fresh.   Price adds up quickly.

Been here a couple times (usually on a weekday evening). They have a decent happy hour drink selection and Asahi on tap. Just like any sushi carousel the cost can add up quickly if you go for the premium plates or end up packing away a stack of plates the size of the Eiffel tower.  Everything was fresh and the servers kept our waters full and checked on us often. Part of the fun is keeping your eyes peeled for a roll or dish that you fancy and seeing it round the bend and come straight to your table. There is a full bar too and nice clean gender neutral bathrooms.  Would definitely make another stop here for some good sushi that brings the same joy as getting your luggage from airport baggage claim  (or rather all the bags from all the claims if you  so desire).

What a pleasant surprise! Visited on a Sunday, and the experience was phenomenal! Excellent sushi, great service, and the most beautiful food creations I have seen in a long time. Thus one is a keeper, well worth a visit!

Good food,  fun with the little conveyor belt taking food around the restaurant (make sure to sit along counter as opposed to tables,  so you don't have to keep asking the people at the end of the table to get your food for you).  Would have given five stars,  but the portions are small. I went with a group and you really need to be aware (plates are color coded to signal different price points).  If you are all sharing the cost may be better, with three of us the cost ended up being $145. Mind you one person had a drink and ordered six mochi.

I can't get enough of this place! My husband and I came to the area for 3 nights and decided to have dinner here twice! Great food and sake.  We had the same waitress on each visit and she was so kind and sweet. What a gem!

Delicious food, good table service, and a great variety! Careful though! It's really easy to spend more than you intend

It's good fish but that's the only redeeming quality. Prices are high and the portions are small, the variety is lacking hard. You can easily spend $80 on two people and not be super full, or you could go to a real sushi place with quality sushi and get more for your money. I've been to the sushi trains in Japan and they're a million miles better. This is a very pared down version of the real thing. Not to mention the staff act like they don't want to be there and I've been there multiple times now.

Good price. Not a lot of options. All of the sushi was great. Avoid non-sushi items. Would return if in downtown for sushi. Plenty if seating. Not very accommodating for groups bigger than 4.

What a great time! My family loved the experience and we were captivated by the conveyer belt. The rolls were delicious and the small plates are great for sharing. Fun dining for 2-4 people.
Mike Cheung

Very pleasantly surprised!  The food quality was really good.  Good selection.  Not bad selection of gluten free and vegetarian options.  They have low sodium and gluten free soy sauce.  There are options for hot food and appetizers from the kitchen as well as sushi on the train.  Fun experience.  I don’t eat raw fish, and it was nice that the contents and whether or not it was cooked or raw was clearly labelled on the conveyer belt.

Sat at the bar while we waited for friends.  You should too!  Andrew was hilarious and we had so much fun.  Once we sat down our server was perfect.  There were seven of us and she kept us in drinks, ginger, and wasabi.  We had a great time and we'll definitely be back.

My new favorite place hands down!! Reasonable price for the portions we got! Came here for the first time on my birthday and was NOT disappointed!! Super impressed! Highly recommend! I just wanted to eat all the sushi!
Nathan Mugsy
23:17 15 Oct 19
Very fun and unique eating experience! I would recommend giving it a try, you won't find a place like this really anywhere else. It's very Instagram-able. Prices vary depending on the dishes you grab, with the most expensive plates being just under 6$

Had a great time here. Good quality and great variety. Great to see cooked and raw items clearly labeled so my pregnant wife could enjoy as well.

Really cute place to eat. The kids loved the novelty of the conveyor belt. Sushi wasn't as cold as I usually like it, but I understand why. Watch yourself or you could end up growing a bill bigger than you expected.
Todd Bakken
12:38 21 Aug 19
Great sushi concept.  Only quibble is that the rolls are on the small side but priced as full size.  Flavor and variety are great.  Staff is attentive and polite.  I wouldn't recommend large groups (anything over 5 people) unless you are willing to be seated at multiple tables.
Dan Auslander

Loved it!  The train is a bit of a gimmick but it's so much fun.  The sushi was fresh and well made.  The selection was consistently stocked up even with a big lunch crowd.  My sushi loving kids enjoyed it very much.

Traditionally served chilled, Shirakabe Junmai Daiginjo has a full-bodied palate with a hint of sweetness and a smooth, velvety feel in the mouth. Clear and bright in the glass, it has subtle aromas of pear, melon, banana and petrichor. The flavors of vanilla, melon, banana and white mushroom are enhanced by a hint of sweetness. Though traditionally chilled, this junmai daiginjo can also be warmed, retaining its balance and heightened creaminess, and gaining a stronger umami profile. Savory notes of rice, cream of wheat, and ripe banana also emerge. 640ml & 15.5% Alc

About the Business
Here at Myriel we highlight wild and farmed ingredients from woods and growers we know. A dinner at Myriel is an invitation to be part of the community that provides for and results from this approach. At the table, we offer the open-hearted hospitality of Bishop Myriel as a way to connect with each other in our busy world.

We pride ourselves on processing our ingredients with care, utilizing careful skill and time to fill our larder with charcuterie, bread, and preserves all crafted in-house. Our menu is based upon what is good at any time, and so changes often with the seasons and with our whims.
